<h2>FOREWORD.</h2>

</div>
<p class="drop-cap">
With the publication of
its <em>Records</em>, under the
title of <em>ANTHOLOGICA RARISSIMA</em>,
the <em>Brovan Society</em>, which has been formed
to carry out research work into the less-known
and more curious folk-lore and
literature of Europe and the Orient, takes
leave to explain its aims and aspirations.</p>

<p>There exists in the literature of
all countries a multitude of books not
usually accorded public circulation. Yet
these books contain some of the most
life-like and diverting material ever
fashioned by human pen. Their contents
have stood the test of time and taste, and
to-day, though publicly ignored, they are
privately applauded. The trend of these
books is, in the main, erotic, or so frank as<span class="pagenum" id="Page_vi">vi</span>
to relegate them to the category of
improper or “privately printed.” Some
have never come under the hands of an
English translator: others in such limited
editions as to make their existence
negligible so far as the average student
is concerned.</p>

<p><em>Anthologica Rarissima</em> is a modest
attempt to remedy this state of affairs. In
a series of volumes the editors will put
before their readers the cream of what is
tantamount to a small library, and a library
not often seen on the book-lover’s shelves.
Herein will be found, set out in plain
English, curious and diverting extracts
from some of the world’s most remarkable
works. The text will be literal and
unexpurgated. Nothing of interest to the
student of folk-lore, psychology and
literature will be omitted or glossed over,
for the editors believe that a classic
castrated is a classic spoilt. The <em>Records</em>
throughout will be enriched by copious
notes and valuable bibliographical references.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_vii">vii</span></p>

<p>So far as the compilers are
aware, no similar anthology exists in the
English tongue. It purports to put within
reach of the student and bibliophile comprehensive
and representative excerpts
from writers, the possession of whose
works would entail time and expense
beyond the means of many collectors.</p>

<p>At present it is impossible to
give a full list of the authors from whom
we shall quote. Mention of such names
as those of Sir Richard Burton, Casanova,
Aretino, the Marquis de Sade, Wilkes,
Boccaccio, Bandello, Masuccio, Straparola,
Rabelais, Lucian, Apuleius, Aristophanes,
Sinistrari, Nicolas Chorier, Poggio, J. S.
Farmer, John Payne, La Fontaine, Chaucer,
Brantôme, Sellon, Pisanus Fraxi, Payne
Knight, Havelock Ellis, Bloch, Huhner,
Forel and Kraft-Ebing, will give some
idea of the work contemplated. Special
attention will be paid to the less-known
folk-lore of Europe and the Orient, as
portrayed in those remarkable books, <cite>Kruptadia</cite>,
<cite>Untrodden Fields of Anthropology</cite>,<span class="pagenum" id="Page_viii">viii</span>
<cite>The Kama Sutra</cite>, <cite>The Ananga Ranga</cite>, <cite>The
Perfumed Garden</cite>, <cite>The Old Man Young
Again</cite>, <cite>Les Cent Nouvelles Nouvelles</cite>,
<cite>Ethnology of the Sixth Sense</cite>, <cite>The Book of
Exposition</cite>, <cite>Priapeia</cite>, <cite>Genital Laws</cite>, <cite>Marriage
Ceremonies and Priapic Rites</cite>, and <cite>Des
Divinités Génératrices</cite>.</p>

<p><em>Anthologica Rarissima</em>, for reasons
which will seem as regrettable as absurd
to the student and collector, must ever be
a privately printed work; its tone, though
erotic, is in no sense pornographic. The
extracts have been selected with care, and
always with an eye to artistry and bibliographical
value. The complete issue,
extending to many volumes, will form
an unique collection in the English
tongue of a type of literature far too little
known in this country.</p>

<p>The subject of our first volume&mdash;virginity
and its treatment in fable, <i lang="fr">conte</i>,
and legend&mdash;is far from exhausted in
these pages. It will be necessary to devote
another <em>Record</em> to the theme at a later<span class="pagenum" id="Page_ix">ix</span>
date. Meanwhile, we have in preparation
Vol. 2: “<em>The Way of a Priest</em>,” Vol. 3:
“<em>The Way of a Wife</em>,” Vol. 4: “<em>The Way
of a Husband</em>,” and Vol. 5: “<em>The Way
of Love</em>.” This last, culled from such
authorities as Ovid, Martial, Catullus,
Aretino, Forberg, Veniero, and the authors
of <cite>The Kama Sutra</cite>, <cite>The Perfumed Garden</cite>,
and <cite>The Ananga Ranga</cite>, should prove the
most complete treatise on the <i lang="la">Ars Amandi</i>
ever published in the English language.</p>

<p>In conclusion, we can only
reiterate what was said at the outset&mdash;that
this work is the outcome of a project
to give the English student and collector
the cream of a rare and remarkable
literature.</p>

<p>We wish to lay special emphasis
on the literal nature of our text, having
often sacrificed style to preserve it. When
translating from French, where an English
translation already existed, we have never
failed to compare and work upon the two
versions for the composition of our
extract.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_x">x</span></p>

<p><cite>Les Cent Nouvelles Nouvelles</cite> is
a case in point, the old French text and
Mr. R. B. Douglas’ English translation
both being utilised in our <em>Record</em>. The
same applies to Casanova; each line of
his <cite>Memoirs</cite>, as existing in the privately
printed English translation, has been
closely compared with Garnier’s French
text; while Aretino’s <cite>Dialogues</cite> will be
scrutinised in no fewer than three
languages. Our aim throughout has been
to put before the reader a rendering in
English which most exactly approximates
to the original work of the author in
question.</p>

<h2>VIRGINITY AND ITS TRADITIONS.</h2>


<div>
  <img class="drop-cap" src="images/pxxi.jpg" alt="" />
</div>
<p class="drop-cap">In devoting a volume to the romance and folk-lore
of Virginity, it may not be inappropriate
first to examine the psychology of a word and a
quality as magical as they are misused.</p>

<p>What is virginity? Is it the possession intact
of that delicate piece of membrane, the poets’ ‘<i lang="la">flos
virginitatis</i>,’ or is it some indescribable, intangible
attribute in no sense dependent on physical perfection?
Does it imply abstention from and ignorance
of all sexual pleasures, or must it be a chastity which
falls little short of stupid, even criminal, innocence?</p>

<p>To us moderns, blessed (or cursed) with a
smattering of science, woman is virginal just as long
as we know or believe her to be, physical qualities
notwithstanding. By the poet of the past, the romanticist,
the mediæval lover, and the ignorant, physical
as well as spiritual proofs were probably required
or expected. To them, virginity was something
tangible; to us it is not.</p>

<p>Nor is the reason far to seek. For while
Havelock Ellis, the greatest authority on sexual
psychology the world has known, describes the
hymen as having acquired in human estimation a
spiritual value which has made it far more than a part
of the feminine body, ... “something that gives
woman all her worth and dignity, ... her market<span class="pagenum" id="Page_xxii">xxii</span>
value,” he goes on to point out that the presence or
absence of the hymen is no real test of virginity.</p>

<p>“There are many ways,” he writes, (<cite>Studies in
the Psychology of Sex</cite>: Philadelphia, 1914: vol. 5:
<cite>Erotic Symbolism</cite>), “in which the hymen may be
destroyed apart from coïtus.... On the other hand,
integrity of the hymen is no proof of virginity, apart
from the obvious fact that there may be intercourse
without penetration.... The hymen may be of a
yielding or folding type, so that complete penetration
may take place and yet the hymen be afterwards
found unruptured. It occasionally happens that the
hymen is found intact at the end of pregnancy.”<a id="FNanchor_1" href="#Footnote_1" class="fnanchor">1</a></p>

<p>And while the foregoing is the exception
rather than the rule, it goes far to prove the fallibility
of the physical, tangible test.</p>

<p>To most of us, virginity is a quality supposedly
prized at all times and by all races. This is far from
the case. As Havelock Ellis points out, (<cite>op. cit.</cite>),
virginity is not usually of any value among peoples
who are entirely primitive. “Indeed, even in the
classic civilisation which we inherit,” he writes, “it is
easy to show that the virgin and the admiration for
virginity are of late growth; the virgin goddesses
were not originally virgins in our modern sense.
Diana was the many-breasted patroness of childbirth
before she became the chaste and solitary huntress,
for the earliest distinction would appear to have been
simply between the woman who was attached to a
man and the woman who followed an earlier rule of<span class="pagenum" id="Page_xxiii">xxiii</span>
freedom and independence; it was a later notion to
suppose that the latter women were debarred from
sexual intercourse.”</p>

<p>A French Army Surgeon, Dr. Jacobus X&mdash;,
(<cite>Untrodden Fields of Anthropology</cite>: Charles Carrington:
Paris, 1898), has some interesting remarks on the
subject, and we offer no apology for reproducing them
at length. Writing on the “Unimportance of the signs
of virginity in the negress,” he says:&mdash;</p>

<p>“The Negroes of Senegal do not attach, as the
Arabs do, considerable importance to the presence of
the real signs of virginity in young girls.... The
non-existence of the material proofs of virginity
seldom give rise to any complaint on the part of the
husband.... Moreover, the size of the virile member
of the Negro<a id="FNanchor_2" href="#Footnote_2" class="fnanchor">2</a> renders it difficult for him to detect any
trick. The black bride, on the wedding night, shows
herself expert in the art of simulating the struggles of
an expiring virginity, and it is considered good taste
for the girls to require almost to be raped. The least
innocent young women are often the most clever at
this game.</p>

<p>“Thus, throughout nearly all Senegal, the
European, who has a taste for maidenheads, can
easily be satisfied, provided he is willing to pay the
price.<a id="FNanchor_3" href="#Footnote_3" class="fnanchor">3</a> At St. Louis women of ill-fame procure young
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_xxiv">xxiv</span>
girls, who bear the significant name of the ‘unpierced,’<a id="FNanchor_4" href="#Footnote_4" class="fnanchor">4</a>
and vary from eight or nine years to the
nubile age. It is even easier to obtain a young girl
before she is nubile than afterwards, on account of the
certainty of her not bearing any children. The price
is within the range of all purses, according to quality,
and you can have a negro girl, warranted ‘unpierced’
(belonging to the category of domestic slaves), for the
modest sum of from eight to sixteen shillings. Of
course, the respectable matron pockets half this sum
for her honorarium....</p>

<p>“ ... The ‘unpierced’ soon lose their right to
the title when they have to do with a Toubab, but, on
account of the size of their genital parts, the loss of
their maidenhead is not such a serious affair for them
as it would be for a little French girl who was not yet
nubile. I have never remarked in a little negress,
who had been deflowered by a White, the valvular
inflammation, which, with us, is noticed as the result
of premature copulation before the parts are sufficiently
developed.... If the reader will remember
that the European, who is below the average dimensions
in regard to his <i lang="la">penis</i>, is like a little boy in
proportion to the negress of ten or twelve years old,
it is not difficult to imagine that the negress he has
deflowered can entirely take in the yard of the White,
the dimensions of which are much less than that of<span class="pagenum" id="Page_xxv">xxv</span>
the adult black.</p>

<p>“ ... When the girl has to do later with a
negro husband, an astringent lotion will render the
bride a pseudo-virgin. The deceived husband, not
having the anatomical knowledge necessary to assure
himself of the real existence of the signs of virginity,
feels a difficulty in copulating, and is far from suspecting
any trick.<a id="FNanchor_5" href="#Footnote_5" class="fnanchor">5</a></p>

<p>“Does not much the same kind of thing
prevail also in Europe? How many girls who have
been deflowered get married without their husband
ever suspecting anything, although he has not the
same physical disadvantages that the black has to
prevent his seeing through the trick? Is it to this<span class="pagenum" id="Page_xxvi">xxvi</span>
amorous blindness that the Greeks and Romans
alluded when they represented Cupid with a bandage
over his eyes? One is almost tempted to believe it.</p>

<p>“ ... In opposition to those who exact the
virginity of the bride, there are others who attach no
importance whatever to it.... The ancient Egyptians
used to make an incision in the hymen previous to
marriage, and St. Athanasius relates that among the
Phœnicians a slave of the bridegroom was charged by
him to deflower the bride.<a id="FNanchor_6" href="#Footnote_6" class="fnanchor">6</a> The Caraib Indians
attached no value to virginity, and only the daughters
of the higher classes were shut up during two years
previous to marriage.</p>

<p>“It appears that among the Chibcha Indians
in Central America virginity is not at all esteemed;
it was considered to be a proof that the maiden had
never been able to inspire love.</p>

<p>“In ancient Peru the old maids were the
objects of high esteem. There were sacred virgins
called ‘Wives of the Sun,’ somewhat similar to the
Roman vestals.<a id="FNanchor_7" href="#Footnote_7" class="fnanchor">7</a> (The nuns of the present day, do
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_xxvii">xxvii</span>
they not style themselves the ‘Spouses of Christ’?).
They made a vow of perpetual chastity.... It is also
said they were buried alive when they happened to
break their vow of chastity, unless indeed they could
prove having conceived, not from a man, but from
the sun.</p>

<p>“Several authors worthy of credence assure
us that these vestals were guarded by eunuchs. The
temple at Cuzco had one thousand virgins, that of
Caranqua two hundred. It would appear, however,
that the virginity of these vestals was not so very
sacred after all, for the Inca Kings used to choose from
among them concubines for themselves or for their<span class="pagenum" id="Page_xxviii">xxviii</span>
principal vassals and favourite friends.</p>

<p>“Marco Polo narrates how young girls were
exposed by their mothers on the public highway in
order that travellers might freely make use of them.<a id="FNanchor_8" href="#Footnote_8" class="fnanchor">8</a>
A young girl was expected to have at least twenty
presents earned by such prostitutions before she could
hope to find a husband. This did not prevent them
from being very virtuous after marriage, nor their
virtue from being much appreciated.<a id="FNanchor_9" href="#Footnote_9" class="fnanchor">9</a></p>

<p>“Waitz assures us that in several countries of<span class="pagenum" id="Page_xxix">xxix</span>
Africa a young girl is preferred for wife when she has
made herself remarked by several amours and by
much fecundity. (<cite>C.f.</cite> Havelock Ellis, <cite>op. cit.</cite>, vol.6:
‘Equally unsound is the notion that the virgin bride
brings her husband at marriage an important capital
which is consumed in the first act of intercourse and
can never be recovered. That is a notion which has
survived into civilisation, but it belongs to barbarism
and not to civilisation. So far as it has any validity it
lies within a sphere of erotic perversity which cannot
be taken into consideration in an estimation of moral
values. For most men, however, in any case, whether
they realise it or not, the woman who has been
initiated into the mysteries of love has a higher erotic
value than the virgin,<a id="FNanchor_10" href="#Footnote_10" class="fnanchor">10</a> and there need be no anxiety
on this ground concerning the wife who has lost her
virginity.’)</p>

<p>“It was impossible,” continues Dr. Jacobus
X&mdash;, “ever to find the signs of virginity among the
Machacura women in Brazil, and Feldner explains
the reason thus:&mdash;</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_xxx">xxx</span></p>

<p>“‘Among them a virgin is never to be found,
for this reason: that the mother from her daughter’s
tenderest years endeavours with the utmost care to
remove all tightness of the vagina and obstacle therein.
With this end in view, the leaf of a tree folded in the
shape of a funnel is held in the right hand, then
while the index finger is introduced into the genital
parts and worked to and fro, warm water is admitted
by means of the funnel.’ (<cite>Journey Across Brazil</cite>, 1828.)</p>

<p>“Among the Sakalaves in Madagascar the
young girls deflower themselves, when the parents
have not previously seen to this necessary preparation
for marriage.</p>

<p>“Among the Balanti of Senegambia, one of
the most degraded races in Africa, the girls cannot
find a husband until they have been deflowered by
their King, who often exacts costly presents from his
female subjects for putting them in condition to be
able to marry.</p>

<p>“Barth, (1856), in describing Adamad, says
that the chief of the Bagoli used to lie the first night
with the daughters of the Fulba, a people under his
sway. Similar facts are related of the aborigines of
Brazil and of the Kinipeto Esquimaux.</p>

<p>“Demosthenes informs us that there was a
celebrated Greek hetaira, named Mæra, who had
seven slaves whom she called her daughters, so that
being supposed to be free a higher price was paid for
their favours. She sold their virginity five or six
times over, and ended by selling the whole lot
together.</p>

<p>“The god Mutinus, Mutunus or Tutunus of
ancient Rome used to have the new brides come and
sit upon his knees, as if to offer him their virginity.<span class="pagenum" id="Page_xxxi">xxxi</span>
St. Augustine says: ‘In the celebration of nuptials the
newly wed bride used to be bidden sit on the shaft of
Priapus.’ Lactantius gives more precise details: ‘And
Mutunus, in whose shameful lap brides sit, in order
that the god may appear to have gathered the first-fruits
of their virginity.’ It appears, however, that
this offering was not merely symbolical, for when
they had become wives, they used to return to the
favourite deity to pray for fecundity.<a id="FNanchor_11" href="#Footnote_11" class="fnanchor">11</a></p>

<p>“Arnobius also asks: ‘Is it Tutunus, on whose
huge organs and bristling tool you think it an auspicious
and desirable thing that your matrons should be
mounted?’</p>

<p>“Pertunda was another hermaphrodite divinity
that St. Augustine maliciously proposed rather to
name the <i lang="la">Deus Pretundus</i> (who strikes first); it was
carried on to the nuptial bed to aid the bridegroom:
‘Pertunda stands there ready in the bed-chamber
for the aid of husbands excavating the virgin pit.’
(Arnobius.)</p>

<p>“The Kondadgis (Ceylon), the Cambodgians,
and other peoples charged their priests with the defloration
of their brides.</p>

<p>“Jager communicated to the Berlin Anthropological
Society a passage from Gemelli Cancri,<span class="pagenum" id="Page_xxxii">xxxii</span>
which mentions a <i lang="la">stupratio officialis</i><a id="FNanchor_12" href="#Footnote_12" class="fnanchor">12</a> practised at a
certain period among the Bisayos of the Philippine
Islands: ‘There is no known example of a custom
so barbarous as that which had been there established,
of having public officials, and even paid very dearly,
to take the virginity of young girls, the same being
considered to be an obstacle to the pleasures of the
husband. As a fact there no longer exists any trace
of this infamous practice since the establishment of
the Spanish rule, ... but even to-day a Bisayo feels
vexed to find his wife safe from suspicion, because
he concludes, that not having excited the desire of
anyone, she must have some bad quality which will
prevent him from being happy with her.’</p>

<p>“On the Malabar Coast, also, there were
Brahmins whose only religious office was to gather
the virgin flower of young girls. These latter used to
pay them for it, without which they could not find
husbands. The King of Calicut himself used to grant
the right of the first night to a Brahmin; the King of
Tamassat grants it to the first stranger who arrives in
the town; whereas the King of Campa reserves to
himself the <i lang="la">jus primæ noctis</i><a id="FNanchor_13" href="#Footnote_13" class="fnanchor">13</a> for all the marriages in
the kingdom. (<cite>De Gubernatis, Histoire des voyageurs
italiens aux Indes Orientales</cite>: Livourne, 1875.)</p>
<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_xxxiii">xxxiii</span></p>
<p>“Warthema says that the King of Calicut,
when he took a wife, chose the most worthy and
learned Brahmin to deflower the maiden; for this
service he received from 400 to 500 crowns. At
Tenasserim fathers used to beg of their daughters to
allow themselves to be deflowered by Christians or
Mohammedans.</p>

<p>“Pascal de Andagoya, who visited Nicaragua
between 1514 and 1522, says that it was usual for a
grand-priest to lie during the first night with the bride,
and Oviedo, (1535), speaking of the Acovacks and other
American nations, relates that the wife, in order that
the marriage should be happy, passed the first nuptial
night with the priest or <i lang="it">piache</i>, and Gomarra, (1551),
relates the same thing of the inhabitants of Cumana.</p>

<p>“In Europe, young girls who are not very
virtuous, and who have studied all the various forms
of flirtation, are most generally passed off as virgins
when they marry. Even when it does not really
exist, there are many ways by which a virginity&mdash;which
perhaps has been sold over and over again by
expert and clever procuresses&mdash;can be simulated. A
little time before going to the nuptial bed, the girl
inserts into her vagina a few drops of pigeon’s blood;
or in some cases she selects for her wedding day the
last day of menstruation. A sponge, skilfully placed,
allows the blood to flow at the moment of the<span class="pagenum" id="Page_xxxiv">xxxiv</span>
catastrophe, when a sudden ‘Oh!’ announces to the
unsuspecting husband that the temple has been
violated for the first time, and that the veil of the
<i lang="la">sanctum sanctorum</i> has really been rent by him. Add
also to these methods injections so astringent that, at
the required time, they will give to a prostitute, whose
gap has been widened by a thousand customers, a
tightness greater than that of a real virgin.”</p>

<p>The more one examines the question, the
more one is convinced that virginity or chastity has
come to be regarded as a spiritual and moral asset
only in civilised, or comparatively civilised, society.
“In considering the moral quality of chastity among
savages,” writes Havelock Ellis (<cite>Studies in the Psychology
of Sex</cite>, vol. 6, p. 147), “we must carefully separate
that chastity which among semi-primitive peoples is
exclusively imposed upon women. This has no
moral quality whatever, for it is not exercised as a
useful discipline, but merely enforced in order to
heighten the economic and erotic value of women.</p>

<p>“Many authorities believe that the regard for
women as property furnishes the true reason for the
widespread insistence on virginity in brides. Thus
A. B. Ellis, speaking of the West Coast of Africa
(<cite>Yoruba Speaking Peoples</cite>, pp. 183 <cite>et seq.</cite>), says that
girls of good class are betrothed as mere children, and
are carefully guarded from men, while girls of lower
class are seldom betrothed, and may lead any life
they choose.”</p>

<p>Virginity in woman, it seems, has been set
on a pedestal unsupported by history, science, or
investigation. It is obviously the outcome of man’s
desire, when he buys or acquires, to obtain unsoiled
goods. Comes a time, however, when the value of<span class="pagenum" id="Page_xxxv">xxxv</span>
these so-called unsoiled goods grows questionable.
Something virgin, in terms of common sense, is not
necessarily something valuable; here enters the
thinking, and, ultimately, the erotic, element. Let a
man fall to asking why he demands virginity, and he
will speedily begin to realise that it is the last thing
he requires. Virginity spells ignorance, awkwardness
and obstacles; maturity means understanding and
co-operation. Thus, by easy stages, we reach the
conclusion, mentioned by Havelock Ellis and quoted
above, that for most men, whether they realise it or
not, the love-wise woman has a greater erotic value
than the virgin.<a id="FNanchor_14" href="#Footnote_14" class="fnanchor">14</a></p>
<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_xxxvi">xxxvi</span></p>
<p>Quoting Westermarck (<cite>History of Human
Marriage</cite>), he goes on to refer to the fact that the
seduction of an unmarried girl “is chiefly, if not
exclusively, regarded as an offence against the parents
or family of the girl,” and there is no indication that
it is ever held by savages that any wrong has been
done to the woman herself.</p>

<p>“Westermarck realises at the same time,” adds
Havelock Ellis, “that the preference given to virgins
has also a biological basis in the instinctive masculine
feeling of jealousy in regard to women who have had
intercourse with other men, and especially in the
erotic charm for men of the emotional state of shyness
which accompanies virginity.”</p>

<p>Here, in all probability, are the most powerful
reasons for the value placed on virginity; each
reason, too, is highly practical. Who among us truly
wants to share his most treasured possession? And
the shy charm of virginity ‘neath the attack of the
amorous lover is as undeniable as it is indescribable.
Hence the virgin’s lure for the old and worn-out roué,
who finds in her shrinking reluctance a stimulant to
his erotic prowess which sympathy, boldness, even
lewdness, have no power to furnish. That quaint old
book, “<cite>Memoirs of a Woman of Pleasure</cite>,” (London,
1780), gives a typical account of the attempt and
failure of an aged rake to ravish the then virginal
heroine of the story.<a id="FNanchor_15" href="#Footnote_15" class="fnanchor">15</a></p>
<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_xxxvii">xxxvii</span></p>
<p>At certain times and with certain peoples the
virgin maid has been fenced about with all manner
of safeguards up to the very hour of her marriage; but
have these and other peoples ever troubled to preserve
the virginity of their daughters as they were at pains
to guard the chastity of their wives? What nation
ever inflicted that ghastly contrivance, the Girdle of
Chastity, upon its virgin daughters? This bar to
erotic pleasure was reserved exclusively for the
potentially froward wife.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_xxxviii">xxxviii</span></p>

<p>Originating in the woollen band worn by the
Spartan virgins<a id="FNanchor_16" href="#Footnote_16" class="fnanchor">16</a>&mdash;a garment removed for the first
time by the husband on the wedding night&mdash;these
Girdles of Chastity, with their padlocks and keys,
were undoubtedly in use in the fourteenth or fifteenth
century, and in use for an unmistakable purpose.
“The first to employ this apparatus,” says Dr. Jacobus
X&mdash;(<cite>Ethnology of the Sixth Sense</cite>: Charles Carrington:
Paris, 1899), “was Francis of Tarrara,
Provost of Padua in the fourteenth century. It was a
belt having a central piece made of ivory, with a
barbed narrow slit down the middle, which was
passed between the legs and fixed there by lock and
key. A specimen of this safety apparatus is to be
seen actually at the Musée de Cluny in Paris.”</p>

<p>Dr. Caufeynon, the great authority on the
subject, believes, however, that these girdles only
date from the Renaissance.<a id="FNanchor_17" href="#Footnote_17" class="fnanchor">17</a> In his remarkable little<span class="pagenum" id="Page_xxxix">xxxix</span>
work, <cite>La Ceinture de Chasteté</cite> (Paris, 1904), which
contains numerous engravings and photographic
designs, he gives an illustration of the specimen in
the Musée de Cluny. Quoting Brantôme (<cite>Lives of
Fair and Gallant Ladies</cite>), he adds:&mdash;</p>

<p>“In the time of Henry the king there lived an
ironmonger who brought to the fair of St. Germain a
dozen of certain machines to bridle the parts of
women; they were fashioned of iron and went round
like a girdle, and went below and were closed with a
key. So cleverly were they fashioned that it was not
possible for the women, when once bridled, to arrive
at the sweet pleasure, there being but a few small
holes in it for pissing.</p>

<p>“‘Tis said there were five or six jealous husbands,
who bought these machines and bridled their
wives with them in such fashion that they might well
have said ‘Farewell, happy time,’ had there not been
one who bethought her of applying to a locksmith
very skilled in his art, to whom she showed the
machine, her own, her husband being then out in the
fields; and he applied his mind so well to the matter
that he made for her a false key, with which the lady
opened or closed the machine at any time and when
she willed.</p>

<p>“The husband never discovered aught to say
on the matter; and the lady gave herself up to her
own good pleasure, despite her foolish, jealous, cuckold
husband, being ever able to live in the freedom of
cuckoldom. But the wicked locksmith who fashioned
the false key tasted of it all; and he did well, so they
say, for he was the first to taste of it.</p>

<p>“They say, too, that there were many gallant
and honest gentlemen of the court who threatened<span class="pagenum" id="Page_xl">xl</span>
that ironmonger with death did he ever presume to
carry about such merchandise; so much so that he
was afraid and returned no more and threw away all
the rest, and no more was heard of. Wherein he was
wise, for it were enough to lose half the world, for
want of any body to people it, through such bridles,
clasps and fastenings of a nature abominable and
detestable and enemies to human multiplication.”</p>

<p>The troubadour Guillaume de Machault
speaks of a key given to him by Agnes of Navarre;
this key was obviously intended to unlock a girdle of
chastity. Nicolas Chorier, in his erotic <cite>Dialogues of
Luisa Sigea</cite> (Paris: Isidore Liseux, 1890), mentions the
apparatus. Although the existence of such girdles
has often been denied, “the presence of many undoubted
specimens in several of the most important
museums of Europe,” says Dr. Jacobus X&mdash;(<cite>Ethnology
of the Sixth Sense</cite>), “places their authenticity
beyond all doubt. This custom existed more
particularly during the time of the Crusades, ...
but a very curious instance is mentioned as having
occurred as late as the middle of the eighteenth
century, for it is recorded that the advocate Feydeau
pleaded before the supreme court of Montpellier on
behalf of a woman who accused her husband of
making her undergo this shameful treatment. (<cite>Petition
against the introduction of padlocks or girdles of
chastity, Montpellier, 1750.</cite>)”</p>

<p>All this only goes to show that virginity and
chastity are two very different things, and that the
latter was obviously of more account than the former
in the eyes of mediæval man. Much the same obtains
to-day. To a certain extent we seek to preserve the
virginity of our daughters; but is there any limit to<span class="pagenum" id="Page_xli">xli</span>
the precautions with which a jealous husband will
fence about his wife? In short, virginity concerns
alone her who loses it; is any man’s for the taking.
Chastity is another person’s property.</p>

<p>This slight survey of virginity would be incomplete
without a reference to the operation of
infibulation<a id="FNanchor_18" href="#Footnote_18" class="fnanchor">18</a>&mdash;the artificial adhesion of the <i lang="la">labia
majora</i> by means of a ring or stitches with a view to
the prevention of sexual intercourse. Kisch, (<cite>The
Sexual Life of Woman</cite>: translated by M. Eden Paul:
London: Wm. Heinemann), quotes the authority of
Ploss-Bartels for saying that this operation is practised
by many savage peoples, among them the Bedschas,
the Gallas, the Somalis, the inhabitants of Harrar, at
Massaua, etc.</p>

<p>“The purpose of this practise,” he adds, “is to
preserve the chastity of the girls until marriage, when
the reverse operative procedure is undertaken. If the
husband goes away on a journey, in many cases the
operation of infibulation is once more performed
upon his wives. Slave-dealers also make use of this
operation so as to prevent their slaves from becoming
pregnant. It is reported, however, that the operation
does not invariably produce the desired effect.”</p>

<p>Nothing we have said or quoted, however,
can alter the fact that virginity has been and will<span class="pagenum" id="Page_xlii">xlii</span>
always be a certain asset in civilised or semi-civilised
communities. There is a romance attached to the
term which neither cynicism nor materialism can kill.
Incidentally, there is a strong business side to the
question. Who, as we said before, wants to feel that
his dearest possession has been shared by others?
Who, in more modern parlance, wants damaged
goods?</p>

<p>While life lasts, the virgin maid will lure the
normal lover, common sense and cold facts notwithstanding.
What the poet sang and the amorous swain
coveted in those by-gone times of pomp and paganism,
in the days of chivalry, and even in that dreary early
Victorian era, will be sung and coveted centuries
hence. Science, new discoveries, new theories, new
ideals, new conditions, cannot oust human nature,
our undeniable birthright. The sanctity and value of
virginity are traditions; and, as Havelock Ellis says,
in that singularly beautiful postscript to his <cite>Studies</cite>,
“there can be no world without traditions; neither
can there be any life without movement. As
Heracleitus knew at the outset of modern philosophy,
we cannot bathe twice in the same stream, though, as
we know to-day, the stream still flows in an unending
circle. There is never a moment when the new dawn
is not breaking over the earth, and never a moment
when the sunset ceases to die. It is well to greet
serenely even the first glimmer of the dawn when we
see it, not hastening toward it with undue speed, nor
leaving the sunset without gratitude for the dying
light that once was dawn.</p>

<p>“In the moral world we are ourselves the
light-bearers, and the cosmic process is in us made
flesh. For a brief space it is granted to us, if we will,<span class="pagenum" id="Page_xliii">xliii</span>
to enlighten the darkness that surrounds our path.
As in the ancient torch-race, which seemed to
Lucretius to be the symbol of all life, we press forward
torch in hand along the course. Soon from behind
comes the runner who will outpace us. All our skill
lies in giving into his hand the living torch, bright
and unflickering, as we ourselves disappear in the
darkness.”</p>

<p>Beautiful words, and fitting monument to a
man who gave thirty years of his life to the production
of a work that will live for all time. Hardly applicable
to our present theme some, perhaps, will say.
We take leave to differ. In the relations between man
and woman all life is epitomised. Each bears the
torch, and the race they run is the life they lead. To
almost all is granted the chance to hand on the torch
in living, breathing prototype.</p>

<p>Let us recognise new conditions, new ideas;
let us welcome, examine and weigh them, that none
may say we do not ‘greet serenely the dawn.’ But
let us also remember that theory cannot oust fact,
nor materialism human nature.</p>

<p>Down the ages man has altered in custom
and habit, but in his spiritual essence not at all. Save
for local and racial differences, humanity has shared
the same passions of pain, sorrow, happiness, anger,
laughter and lust throughout all time. Human nature
alone does not change; our birthright is immutable.
Human nature ever has, and ever will, set store by
virginity. It has become a tradition. And without
tradition, as the great psychologist has truly told us,
there is no world.</p>

</div>
<p class="drop-cap">In a certain reign, in a certain kingdom, there
lived once on a time three peasant brethren,
who quarrelled among themselves and divided
up their goods; they did not share
equally, and the division gave much to the elder
brethren but very little to the youngest.</p>

<p>All three were young lads. They went forth
together into the courtyard, saying one to the other:</p>

<p>“‘Tis time for us to wed.”</p>

<p>“‘Tis well enough for ye,” quoth the youngest
brother. “Ye are rich, and the rich can marry.
But what may I do? I am poor. I have not even a
log of wood to my name. All I have for a fortune is
a yard which reacheth to my knees!”</p>

<p>On this very moment there chanced to pass
a merchant’s daughter, who overheard these words
and said to herself:</p>

<p>“Ah! that I might have this young man for a
husband! He hath a yard that reacheth to his very
knees!”</p>

<p>The two elder brethren married; the youngest
remained single.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_2">2</span></p>

<p>The merchant’s daughter, back in her home,
had no thought in her head but to wed the young
peasant; several rich merchants sought her hand in
marriage, but she would have none of them.</p>

<p>“I will wed with none save this young man,”
quoth she.</p>

<p>Her father and mother sought to dissuade her.
“What art thinking on, foolish one?” said they.
“Come back to thy senses! Why wouldst wed with
a poor peasant?”</p>

<p>“Concern not yourselves with that!” answered
she. “‘Tis not ye who will have to live with him!”</p>

<p>The merchant’s daughter came to an understanding
with the matchmaker, and dispatched her to
tell the young man to come without fail and ask her
hand in marriage. The matchmaker went to see him,
saying:</p>

<p>“Hearken, oh! my little dove. Why standest
there gaping? Go ask in marriage the merchant’s
daughter. She hath awaited thee this long time, and
will wed thee with joy.”</p>

<p>The young man swiftly apparelled himself,
donned a new smock-frock, took his new hat, and hied
him forthwith to the house of the merchant to ask
his daughter’s hand in marriage. When the
merchant’s daughter perceived him, when she recognised
that it was indeed he whose yard reached to his
knees, she fell to asking her father and mother for
their blessing on a union indissoluble.</p>

<p>On the wedding night she went to bed with
her husband, and perceived that he had but a little
yard, smaller even than a finger.</p>

<p>“Oh! thou scoundrel!” she cried. “Thou
boastest ownership of a yard reaching to thy knees!<span class="pagenum" id="Page_3">3</span>
What hast done with it?”</p>

<p>“Dear wife, thou knowest that I was a bachelor,
and very poor; when I resolved to marry, I had
neither gold nor aught else to enable me so to do. So
I have pledged my yard.”<a id="FNanchor_20" href="#Footnote_20" class="fnanchor">20</a></p>

<p>“And for what sum hast thou pledged thy yard?”</p>

<p>“But for little&mdash;for fifty roubles.”</p>

<p>“Good. On the morrow I will go seek my
mother, I will beg money of her, and thou wilt go
without fail to recover thy yard. If thou dost not buy
it back, enter not the house!”</p>

<p>She waited until morn, then ran swiftly in
search of her mother, saying:</p>

<p>“Grant me a favour, little mother. Give me
fifty roubles. I have sore need of them.”</p>

<p>“But tell me why thou hast need of them.”</p>

<p>“See, little mother. My husband had a yard
which reached to his knees. When we desired to
marry, he knew not where to find the money, the poor
man, and he hath pledged his yard for fifty roubles.
Now my husband hath but a tiny yard, even smaller
than a finger. ‘Tis of the utmost necessity, therefore,
to buy back his ancient yard.”</p>

<p>The mother, understanding the need, drew
fifty roubles from her purse, and gave them to her
daughter. The latter returned to her home and gave
the money to her husband, saying:</p>

<p>“Go! Run now swiftly to buy back thine
ancient yard, in order that strangers may not make
use of it!”</p>

<p>The young man took the money and went
forth, eyes downcast. Where might he turn now?<span class="pagenum" id="Page_4">4</span>
Where find for his wife such a yard? Best leave it
to chance.</p>

<p>He went forward, now swiftly, now slowly,
and at length he encountered an aged woman.</p>

<p>“Good day, good woman.”</p>

<p>“Good day, good man. Whither goest thou at
this pace?”</p>

<p>“Ah, good woman&mdash;would thou knewest&mdash;would
thou didst know my sorrow&mdash;would I might
tell thee whither I go!”</p>

<p>“Tell me thy sorrow, little dove. Perchance
I can come to thine aid.”</p>

<p>“I am shamed to tell it thee.”</p>

<p>“Fear not, have no shame. Speak boldly.”</p>

<p>“Ah, well, see here, good woman. I had
boasted of having a yard that reached to my knees; a
merchant’s daughter, who had heard this, espoused
me, but when she lay with me on our wedding night
and perceived that I had but a little yard, smaller than
a finger, she cried out and asked what I had done
with my great yard. I told her that I had pledged it
for fifty roubles; she gave me the money and bade
me buy it back without fail; otherwise, I might not
show myself again at my home. And I know not
how to satisfy my little dove.”</p>

<p>The aged woman made answer to him:</p>

<p>“Give me thy money,” said she, “and I will
find a remedy for thy sorrow.”</p>

<p>Forthwith he drew the fifty roubles from his
pocket and gave them to her; the aged woman
handed to him a ring.</p>

<p>“Come, take this ring,” quoth she. “Put it
only on thy finger nail.”</p>

<p>The young man took the ring, and scarce had<span class="pagenum" id="Page_5">5</span>
he put it on his finger nail ere his yard stretched
itself a cubit’s length.</p>

<p>“Well, what of it?” asked the aged woman.
“Doth thy yard reach to thy knees?”</p>

<p>“Yea, good woman. It reacheth even below
my knees.”</p>

<p>“Now, my little dove, pass the ring down thy
whole finger.”</p>

<p>He passed the ring over his entire finger, and
his yard lengthened out even unto seven versts.<a id="FNanchor_21" href="#Footnote_21" class="fnanchor">21</a></p>

<p>“Ah! good woman! where shall I lodge it?
It will bring me ill fortune with my wife.”</p>

<p>“Thrust up the ring to thy finger nail; thy
yard will be but a cubit’s span. This for thy guidance&mdash;pay
attention and never put the ring beyond
thy finger nail.”</p>

<p>He thanked the aged woman, and retook the
road homeward; and as he journeyed he rejoiced in
that he need not appear before his wife with empty
hands.</p>

<p>But as he went, he felt a desire to eat. Going
aside, he seated himself not far from the road at the
foot of a burdock, drew biscuits from his wallet,
dipped them in water, and fell to eating. Anon,
desire to slumber o’er-came him; he lay down, belly
uppermost, and played with the ring. He put it upon
his finger nail, and his yard rose to the height of a
cubit’s span; he pressed his whole finger through the
ring, and his yard rose to a height of seven versts; he
removed the ring, and his yard became small as
before. He examined and re-examined the ring, and
thus he fell asleep. But he forgot to conceal the ring,<span class="pagenum" id="Page_6">6</span>
which rested upon his belly.</p>

<p>There chanced to pass in a carriage a lord
and his wife. The lord saw, not far from the road, a
peasant aslumbering, and upon his belly glittered a
ring, as it were a live coal in the sun. He stopped
the horses, saying to his lackey:</p>

<p>“Approach the peasant, take the ring, and
bring it to me.”</p>

<p>Straightway the lackey ran to the peasant,
and carried back the ring to the lord. And these
went on their way.</p>

<p>The lord admired the ring.</p>

<p>“Look thou, my dear loved one,” said he to his
wife. “What a superb ring! Behold! I put it upon
my finger.” And he passed it down his whole finger.</p>

<p>Straightway his yard reached out, o’erturned
the coachman from his box seat, struck one of the
mares right beneath the tail, pushed aside the animal,
and caused the carriage to go ahead of it.<a id="FNanchor_22" href="#Footnote_22" class="fnanchor">22</a></p>

<p>The lady beheld what misfortune had befallen,
was greatly affrighted, and cried with all her
force to the lackey, saying:</p>

<p>“Run most swiftly to the peasant and lead
him hither!”</p>

<p>The lackey sped amain to the peasant and
aroused him, saying:</p>

<p>“Come swiftly, my little peasant, to my
master!”</p>

<p>The peasant sought his ring.</p>

<p>“A curse on thee! Thou hast taken my ring!”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_7">7</span></p>

<p>“Seek not,” said the lackey. “Come to my
master. He hath thy ring, which hath caused us a
great fuss.”</p>

<p>The peasant ran to the carriage. Quoth the
lord to him:</p>

<p>“Pardon me, but come to my aid in my misfortune!”</p>

<p>“What wilt give me, lord?”</p>

<p>“Here are one hundred roubles.”</p>

<p>“Give me two hundred and I will deliver
thee.”</p>

<p>The lord drew two hundred roubles from his
pocket, the peasant took the money, and withdrew the
ring from the lord’s finger, whereat the yard vanished
as if by magic, and there was left to the lord but his
former little instrument.</p>

<p>The lord went his way, and the peasant hied
him homeward with the ring. His wife was at the
window and saw him come; she ran to meet him.</p>

<p>“Hast brought it back?” asked she.</p>

<p>“I have.”</p>

<p>“Show it me!”</p>

<p>“Come within the chamber. I cannot show
it thee outside.”</p>

<p>They entered the chamber, nor did the wife
cease to repeat: “Show it me! Show it me!”</p>

<p>He placed the ring on his finger-nail, and his
yard lengthened a cubit’s span; then he drew off his
drawers, saying: “Behold, wife!”</p>

<p>The wife fell on his neck.</p>

<p>“My dear little husband, here is truly an
instrument that will be better in our house than with
strangers. Come swiftly and eat; then we will to bed
and make trial of it.”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_8">8</span></p>

<p>Forthwith she put upon the table all manner
of meats and beverages, and they fell to eating and
drinking. Having feasted, they betook themselves to
bed. When he had pierced his wife with this yard,
she, for three whole days, was ever peering ‘neath his
garment; it seemed to her that the yard was ever
thrusting between her legs.</p>

<p>She went to pay a visit to her mother, what
time her husband hied him to the garden and lay
down ‘neath an apple tree.</p>

<p>“Well,” asked the mother of her daughter,
“have ye bought back the yard?”</p>

<p>“We have bought it back, little mother.”</p>

<p>And the mother had but one thought: to steal
away, profiting by her daughter’s visit, to run to the
house of her son-in-law, and to make trial of his
great yard.</p>

<p>And while the daughter chattered, the mother
came to the house of the son-in-law and sped into
the garden. The son-in-law was aslumbering; the
ring was on his finger nail, and his yard stood erect to
the height of a cubit’s span.</p>

<p>“I will mount upon his yard,” said the good
mother to herself.</p>

<p>And she mounted, in sooth, upon the yard,
and balanced herself thereon.</p>

<p>But, by ill fortune, the ring slipped to the
base of the finger of the son-in-law what time he
slept, and the yard raised the good mother to the
height of seven versts.</p>

<p>The daughter perceived that her mother had
gone forth, she divined the reason, and hastened to
return home. In her house there was no one. She
went into the garden, and what saw she? Her<span class="pagenum" id="Page_9">9</span>
husband aslumbering, his yard raised to a vast height,
and, all in the clouds, the good mother, scarce visible;
and she, when the wind blew, turned upon the yard
as though upon a stake.</p>

<p>What to do? How remove her mother from
off the yard?</p>

<p>A great crowd had come together; they discussed;
they proferred counsel. Said some: there is
naught for it but to take a hatchet and cut the yard.
Said others: no, ‘tis a bad plan. Why lose two
souls? For as soon as the yard is cut, the woman
will fall and kill herself. ‘Tis better to pray to God
that perchance by some miracle the old woman will
disentangle herself from it.</p>

<p>During this time the son-in-law awoke, and
perceived that his ring had descended to the base of
his finger, that his yard raised itself towards the sky
to a height of seven versts, and that it nailed him
solidly to the earth, in such wise that he could not
turn upon his other side.</p>

<p>He withdrew very softly the ring from his
finger; his yard descended to the height of a cubit’s
span; and the son-in-law saw his mother-in-law
suspended upon it.</p>

<p>“How camest thou there, little mother?”</p>

<p>“Pardon, my little son-in-law. I will not do
it any more!”</p>

<h3><i>VARIANT.</i></h3>


<div>
  <img class="drop-cap" src="images/o.jpg" alt="" />
</div>
<p class="drop-cap">Once on a time a tailor possessed a magic ring;
as soon as he put it upon his finger, his yard
assumed an extraordinary development. It
fell out that he went to work at the house of
a woman; by nature he was gay and given to jesting,
and when he lay down to slumber he neglected
always to cover his genitals.</p>

<p>The woman observed that he had a yard of
great proportions; desirous of sampling the power of
such an instrument, she summoned the tailor to her
chamber.</p>

<p>“Hearken,” quoth she to him. “Consent to
sin once with me.”</p>

<p>“Why not, madam? But only on one condition&mdash;that
thou dost not fart! If thou dost fart, thou
shalt pay me three hundred roubles.”</p>

<p>“Very good,” answered she.</p>

<p>They betook themselves to bed; the good woman
took all possible precautions not to expel wind
during the sexual act; she instructed her chambermaid
to seek a large onion, to thrust this into her fundament,
and to hold it there with both hands. These orders
were carried out minutely, but at the first assault
delivered by the tailor upon the woman, the onion
was violently expelled and struck the chambermaid<span class="pagenum" id="Page_11">11</span>
with such force that she was killed outright!</p>

<p>The woman lost her three hundred roubles;
the tailor pocketed this sum and hied him homeward.
Having journeyed some distance, he felt a desire to
slumber and lay down in a field. He placed the ring
upon his finger and his yard stretched to the length
of one verst. As he lay thus, slumber o’ertook him,
and whilst he slept came seven starving wolves,
which devoured the greater part of his yard. He
awoke as if naught had chanced,<a id="FNanchor_23" href="#Footnote_23" class="fnanchor">23</a> took the ring from
his finger, put it in his pocket, and pursued his way.</p>

<p>Came night, and the tailor entered the house
of a peasant. Now this peasant had married a young
woman who had a liking for well-membered men.
The guest went to sleep in the courtyard, leaving his
yard exposed. Perceiving it, the peasant’s wife felt a
great desire; raising her robe, she coupled with the
tailor.</p>

<p>“Good,” quoth he to himself; and he placed
the ring on his finger, and his yard rose little by little
to the height of one verst. But when the wife perceived
herself so far from the earth, all desire to futter
left her, and she clung with both hands to this strange
support in mid-air.</p>

<p>Beholding the peril that beset the wretched
woman, her neighbours and relations fell to praying
for the safety of both. But the tailor gently withdrew
the ring from his finger; gradually the dimensions
of his member decreased, and, when it reached
but to a small height, the woman jumped to earth.</p>

<p>“Ah! insatiable coynte,” quoth the tailor<span class="pagenum" id="Page_12">12</span>

<p class="drop-cap">Once on a time a youth, wishing to become a
smith, quitted his village and hired himself
as an apprentice to a farrier. His master was
a busy man, all the beds in his house being
filled by his workmen, and when evening came he
was sore pressed to find sleeping quarters for his apprentice.
Reflecting long, he thus finally argued:&mdash;</p>

<p>“In each bed are several persons; my daughter
alone hath one to herself. With her will I put the
youth to sleep. His parents are good people, and I
have known him from boyhood. There is no danger.”</p>

<p>When these two were in bed together, the
youth began to caress the daughter, a maid nigh unto
sixteen years, and since she did not repulse him, he
lost no time in showing her how one makes love.
The daughter found the business very much to her
liking, and Pierre (for so the apprentice was named)
gave her several lessons in this pretty game. She
did not tire, and wished that the play might last the
whole night long; but Pierre, awearied, would fain
have slept. Anon, when he began to grow drowsy,
she pinched him and snuggled up to him; but he did
not respond to her allurements.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_14">14</span></p>

<p>“Pierre,” said she, “dost play no more with
thine implement?”</p>

<p>“No&mdash;’tis used up,” quoth Pierre.</p>

<p>“‘Tis a pity,” said the girl. “Why is it not
more solid? Would it cost much to have another?”</p>

<p>“Yea&mdash;at least three or four hundred francs.”</p>

<p>“I myself have not that sum; but I know
where my father keepeth his money, and on the
morrow I will give thee the wherewithal to procure
another. What dost thou call it?”</p>

<p>“‘Tis called an ‘instrument’,”<a id="FNanchor_26" href="#Footnote_26" class="fnanchor">26</a> quoth Pierre.</p>

<p>In the morning the girl, taking her father’s
money, gave it to the apprentice, who hied him to the
town and made pretence of buying another instrument;
and when night came, he played on his
instrument to the infinite satisfaction of the girl.</p>

<p>On the morrow the apprentice received a
letter, wherein he learned that his mother lay ill and
desired to see him. He started on his journey forthwith.
Anon the girl appeared, and not seeing the
apprentice, inquired:</p>

<p>“Where is Pierre?”</p>

<p>And they answered her that he was gone and
would return no more. Whereat she sped after him,
and when she perceived him afar off, cried out:&mdash;</p>

<p>“Pierre! Pierre! At least leave me the instrument!”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_15">15</span></p>

<p>Pierre, who was in a field at the moment,
wrenched up a big turnip, and casting it into a swamp
at the feet of the girl, cried out:&mdash;</p>

<p>“Take it&mdash;’tis there!”</p>

<p>And while the girl sought the instrument, he
continued on his way.</p>

<p>With both her eyes she looked, but of Pierre’s
instrument could perceive no vestige. Anon she sat
down on the edge of the swamp and gave herself up
to tears. Presently there chanced to pass the vicar,
who made inquiry as to the cause of her grief.</p>

<p>“Oh! thy reverence!” she made answer.
“The instrument hath fallen in the swamp and I
cannot recover it. A sad pity, for ‘tis a precious instrument
and cost three or four hundred francs.”</p>

<p>“Let us both seek,” quoth the vicar. “I will
aid thee.”</p>

<p>He tucked up his gown, and both fell to
seeking in the swamp, which was somewhat deep.
Anon the girl turned her head, and perceiving the
vicar with his garments tucked up above his hips,
cried out:&mdash;</p>

<p>“Ah! thy reverence! No need for further
search! ‘Tis thou who hast the instrument ‘twixt thy
legs!”</p>

<h3><i>EXCURSUS</i> to <i>THE INSTRUMENT</i></h3>


<p>A variant of the foregoing story, (<cite>The
Instrument</cite>), is to be found in <cite>Le Moyen de Parvenir</cite>
(Béroalde de Verville). The editors of <cite>Kruptadia</cite>
draw attention to it, quoting the following extract:&mdash;</p>

<p>The simpleton husband Hauteroue, while
futtering his wife, remarked:&mdash;</p>

<p>“What a labour it is, my love!”</p>

<p>“I am not surprised,” quoth she. “Thou dost
work with a bad implement.”</p>

<p>“I should have a better had I the money.”</p>

<p>“Let not that hinder thee; I will give thee the
money on the morrow.”</p>

<p>When the husband received his money, he set
out to enjoy himself; then he went to bed with his
wife, whom he pleasured well.</p>

<p>“Ho! my love!” said she. “This implement
is as good as the one thou hadst. But, love, what hast
done with the other?”</p>

<p>“I have thrown it away, my love.”</p>

<p>“Bah! Thou hast made a great mistake.
‘Twould have served for my mother!”</p>

</div>
<p class="drop-cap">Two young girls held converse together.
Quoth one:</p>

<p>“Like thee, little one, I, too, will never
marry.”</p>

<p>“And why should we marry against our
will?” said the other. “We have no masters.”</p>

<p>“Hast seen, little one, that instrument with
which men make trial upon us?”</p>

<p>“I have seen it.”</p>

<p>“And is it not huge?”</p>

<p>“Little one, it is assuredly of the size of an
arm!”</p>

<p>“One would never come out of it alive.”</p>

<p>“Come, I will tickle thee with a straw.”</p>

<p>“That also hurteth me.”</p>

<p>The foolish one lay down, and the wiser fell
to tickling her with a straw. “Ah! that hurteth!” she
repeated.</p>

<p>Now the father of one of the young girls
forced her to take a husband; she waited two nights,
then went to see her young friend.</p>

<p>“Good day, little one,” she said.</p>

<p>The latter besought her to relate forthwith
what had befallen.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_18">18</span></p>

<p>“Ah!” answered the young wife. “Had I
known, had I truly known the business, I had not
listened to my father or my mother. I thought to lose
my life, and my tongue hung from my mouth a foot
in length.”</p>

<p>The young friend was so affrighted that she
had no wish to speak further of fiancés.</p>

<p>“I will wed with none,” quoth she. “And if
my father seeks to employ violence, 1 will espouse,
for form’s sake, the first bachelor I encounter.”</p>

<p>Now there was in the same village a young
lad and a very poor. None would give him a seemly
maid in marriage, and he did not desire an ill; by
chance he overheard the conversation of the young
girls.</p>

<p>“Wait,” thought he to himself. “I will play
a trick on that one. At a suitable moment I will say
that I have no yard.”</p>

<p>Came a day when the young girl went to
mass; she beheld the lad leading his horse, thin and
unshod, to the watering place; the poor beast went
limping, and the young girl laughed. They came to
a steep slope; the mare climbed with difficulty, then
fell and rolled on her back. The lad was annoyed,
seized the mare by her tail, and fell to beating her
without pity, saying:</p>

<p>“Get up! Thou wilt flay all the skin off thyself!”</p>

<p>“Why beatest thou the horse, brigand?”
asked the young girl.</p>

<p>The lad lifted the tail, looked at it and said:</p>

<p>“And what should I do? Futter her? But
I have no yard.”</p>

<p>When the girl heard his words, she pissed<span class="pagenum" id="Page_19">19</span>
herself with joy, saying:</p>

<p>“Behold! the good God hath sent me a fiancé
after my liking!”</p>

<p>She returned to her house, sat down in a
secluded corner, and fell to pouting. Presently all
the family seated themselves at table, calling on her
to come, but she replied in anger:</p>

<p>“I will not!”</p>

<p>“Come, Douniouchka,” said the mother.
“What art thinking of? Tell me.”</p>

<p>The father intervened.</p>

<p>“Why dost pout? Perchance thou dost
desire to wed? Thou wouldst wed with this one and
not with that?”
The young girl had but one idea in her head:
to wed Ivan the No-Yard.</p>

<p>“I will wed,” she replied, “neither this one
nor that. An it please ye or not, I will wed Ivan.”</p>

<p>“What sayest thou, little fool? Art enraged,
or hast lost thy reason? Thou wouldst share thy life
with him?”</p>

<p>“He is my destiny. Seek not to marry me to
another, else I will drown or strangle myself.”</p>

<p>Hitherto the old father had not honoured the
poverty-stricken Ivan with so much as a look, but
now he went himself to the lad to make him release
his daughter. He approached. Ivan was seated,
repairing an old hempen shoe.</p>

<p>“Good day, Ivanouchka.”</p>

<p>“Good day, old man.”</p>

<p>“What dost thou?”</p>

<p>“I seek to mend my hempen shoes.”</p>

<p>“Shoes? Thou hast need of new boots.”</p>

<p>“Since I have with difficulty amassed fifteen<span class="pagenum" id="Page_20">20</span>
copeks to buy these shoes, where shall I find money
to purchase boots?”</p>

<p>“And why dost thou not marry, Vania?”</p>

<p>“Who would give me his daughter?”</p>

<p>“I, if thou wilt! Kiss me on the mouth.”</p>

<p>And they came to an understanding.</p>

<p>At the rich man’s house there was no lack of
beer and brandy. The girl and the lad were wed
forthwith, high feast was held, and then the best man
conducted the young people to their sleeping chamber
and put them to bed. One knows the sequel.
Ivan pierced the young girl till she bled and there
was a road by which he might travel.</p>

<p>“What a blockhead, what a fool I have been!”
thought Dounuka. “What have I done? How much
better had I taken one richly-endowed! But where
hath he found this yard? I will question him.”</p>

<p>And she questioned him, saying:</p>

<p>“Hearken, Ivanouchka. Where hast got this
yard?”</p>

<p>“I have hired it from mine uncle for one
night.”</p>

<p>“Ah! my little dove! Beg it of him for yet
another night.”</p>

<p>A second night passed and she said to him
again:</p>

<p>“Little dove! Beg of thine uncle if he will
not sell thee the yard outright. But bargain well.”</p>

<p>“Good. One can always bargain.”</p>

<p>He went to the house of his grandsire, came
to an understanding with him,<a id="FNanchor_28" href="#Footnote_28" class="fnanchor">28</a> and returned to his
home.</p>
<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_21">21</span></p>
<p>“Well, what of it?” asked his wife.</p>

<p>“What can I say?” answered the lad. “There
was no bargaining with him. We must give him
three hundred roubles or he will not yield us the
yard. And where may we get this sum?”</p>

<p>“Ah, well. Return and beg him to hire thee
the yard for yet another night. To-morrow I ask my
father for the money, and we will buy the yard outright.”</p>

<p>“Nay&mdash;go thyself and ask it of him. In sooth,
I dare not.”</p>

<p>She went to the uncle’s house, entered his
apartment, prayed to heaven, and bowed, saying:</p>

<p>“Good day, mine uncle.”</p>

<p>“Thou art welcome. What good news hast
thou?”</p>

<p>“See, mine uncle, I am shamed to speak, but
‘twould be a sin an I kept silent. Lend thy yard to
Ivan for a night.”</p>

<p>The relative took counsel with himself, shook
his head, and said:</p>

<p>“It can be lent, but care must be taken of a
yard belonging to another.”</p>

<p>“We will take care of it, uncle. I swear by
the Cross. And to-morrow, without fail, we will buy
it outright of thee.”</p>

<p>“Go, then, and send Ivan to me.”</p>

<p>She bowed to the earth and left the house.</p>

<p>On the morrow she went to seek her father,
asked of him three hundred roubles for her husband,
and bought for herself a good yard.</p>

<h3><i>EXCURSUS</i> to <i>THE ENCHANTED RING</i>,
<i>THE INSTRUMENT</i>, and <i>THE TIMOROUS
FIANCÉE</i>.</h3>


<p>Each of the three foregoing stories is remarkable
for the fact that it contains the same naïve idea&mdash;the
possibility of purchasing a male “implement.”
The idea is fairly common in folk-lore stories of virginity,
but, almost always, results in a highly humorous
situation. It is a crude but very effective method
of depicting the ignorance, even stupidity, of a virgin
girl. It also affords the story-teller an opportunity of
an indirect reference to a favourite theme&mdash;the erotic
tendency of women once their sexual senses are
aroused.<a id="FNanchor_29" href="#Footnote_29" class="fnanchor">29</a></p>

<p>One episode of <cite>The Enchanted Ring</cite> (the
remarkable qualities of the young man’s <i lang="la">penis</i> when
adorned with the ring) can hardly fail to recall “<cite>The
Night of Power</cite>,” (Sir Richard F. Burton’s <cite>Thousand
Nights and a Night</cite>), wherein the husband’s organs
undergo rapid and wonderful transformation. This
tale is described by Sir Richard Burton as “the
grossest and most brutal satire on the sex, suggesting
that a woman would prefer an additional inch of<span class="pagenum" id="Page_23">23</span>
<i lang="la">penis</i> to anything this world or the next can offer
her.” One cannot help noting, none the less, the
indecent anxiety of the mother-in-law, in our story
from <cite>Kruptadia</cite>, to sample the mighty yard of the
newly-returned husband.<a id="FNanchor_30" href="#Footnote_30" class="fnanchor">30</a></p>

<h2 title="ADVENTURES WITH HEDVIGE AND HELÈNE AT GENEVA.">ADVENTURES WITH HEDVIGE AND
HELÈNE AT GENEVA.<a id="FNanchor_31" href="#Footnote_31" class="fnanchor">31</a></h2>

<blockquote>

<p><i>Casanova makes the acquaintance of two
charming cousins, Hedvige and Helène, at Geneva.
After sundry meetings, at which theology and sexual
matters are discussed in a frank and amusing fashion,
Casanova gets the chance to take his two charmers for
a stroll in the garden where they can be sure of immunity
from interruption. Casanova’s opportunity
occurs as a result of Hedvige’s desire to know why a
deity could not impregnate a woman, a male acquaintance
having said that he could not with propriety
expound such mysteries to her. Casanova gladly
agrees to make the matter clear, adding, however,
that he must be allowed to speak quite plainly. The
text continues:</i></p></blockquote>


<div>
  <img class="drop-cap" src="images/y.jpg" alt="" />
</div>
<p class="drop-cap">Yea, speak clearly,” quoth Hedvige, “for none
can hear us; but I am forced to confess that
I am cognisant of the formation of man only
in theory and by lecture. True, I have seen
statues, but I have never seen and still less have I<span class="pagenum" id="Page_25">25</span>
examined real<a id="FNanchor_32" href="#Footnote_32" class="fnanchor">32</a> man. And thou, Helène?”</p>

<p>“I have never desired so to do.”</p>

<p>“Why not? ‘Tis good to know all.”</p>

<p>“Well, my charming Hedvige,” said I, “thy
theologian wished to tell thee that Jesus was not
capable of erection.”</p>

<p>“What is that?”</p>

<p>“Give me thy hand.”</p>

<p>“I feel it and I can picture it; for, without
this natural phenomenon, man could not impregnate
his consort. And this foolish theologian pretendeth
that it is an imperfection!”</p>

<p>“Yea, for this phenomenon springeth from
desire, for ‘tis very true that it would not have worked
in me, sweet Hedvige, had I not found thee charming
and had not what I had seen of thee given me the
most seductive idea of the beauties I see not. Tell
me frankly if, after feeling this rigidity of mine, thou
dost not experience an agreeable sensation?”</p>

<p>“I confess it; ‘tis precisely where thou
pressest. Dost not feel as I, my dear Helène, an
itching and a longing on likening to the very true
discourse given to us by this gentleman?”</p>

<p>“Yea, I feel it, but I feel it very often, without
any discourse exciting it.”</p>

<p>“And then,” quoth I, “Nature forceth thee to
appease it thus?”</p>

<p>“Not at all.”</p>

<p>“Oh, that it were so, Hedvige! Even in sleep
one’s hand strayeth there by instinct; and, lacking
this easement, I have read that we should suffer
terrible maladies.”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_26">26</span></p>

<p>And whilst we continued this philosophical
converse, which the youthful theologian sustained
with an authoritative tone, and which brought a look
of voluptuousness to the lovely complexion of her
cousin, we came to the edge of a fine pool where one
descended by a marble staircase to bathe. Although
it was chilly, our heads were warm, and it came to
me to propose to the maidens that they put their feet
in the water, assuring them that it would do them
good and, if they permitted me, that I would count it
an honour to remove their shoes and stockings.</p>

<p>“Come,” said Hedvige, “I like the project
well.”</p>

<p>“I, too,” said Helène.</p>

<p>“Seat yourselves, ladies, on the first stair.”</p>

<p>Behold them, then, seated, and thy servant,
on the fourth stair, busy unshoeing them, what time
he extolled the beauty of their legs and made pretence
to be incurious at the moment to see higher than the
knee. Then, having gone down to the water, they
had perforce to lift their garments, and in this business
I encouraged them.</p>

<p>“Ah, well,” remarked Hedvige, “men also
have thighs.”</p>

<p>Helène, who would have felt shame to show
less courage than her cousin, did not hang back.</p>

<p>“Come, my charming naiads,” quoth I, “‘tis
enough. Ye will catch cold if ye remain for long in
the water.”</p>

<p>They reascended the staircase backwards,
ever holding up their robes lest they might wet them;
and it fell to me to dry their limbs with all the handkerchiefs
that I possessed. This pleasant task permitted
me to see and touch everything at my leisure,<span class="pagenum" id="Page_27">27</span>
and the reader will scarce need my word to affirm
that I made the best of my opportunity. The pretty
niece (Hedvige) declared that I was too curious, but
Helène let me have my way with an air so tender
and so languid that I was hard pressed not to push
the matter further. In the end, having again put on
their shoes and stockings, I told them that I was enchanted
to have viewed the secret charms of the two
most lovely ladies in Geneva.</p>

<p>“What effect hath it on thee?” asked Hedvige
of me.</p>

<p>“I dare not tell ye to look, but feel, both of ye.”</p>

<p>“Bathe thou thyself also.”</p>

<p>“Impossible. The business is too long for a
man.”</p>

<p>“But we have yet two full hours to remain
here without fear of interruption from anyone.”</p>

<p>This response caused me to see the happiness
that awaited me; but I did not think fit to expose
myself to an illness by entering the water in the state
in which I was. Seeing a summer-house not far off
and assured that M. Tronchin would have left it
open, I took my two beauties by the arm and led them
thither, not letting them guess, however, my intentions.</p>

<p>The summer-house was full of vases of <i lang="fr">pot
pourri</i>, pretty engravings, and so forth; but what I
valued most was a large and lovely divan, fit for
repose and for pleasure. There, seated ‘twixt these
two beauties and lavishing caresses upon them, I said
that I desired to show them that which they had
never seen, at the same time exposing to their gaze
the principal agent of humanity. They raised themselves
to admire it, and then, taking the hand of each<span class="pagenum" id="Page_28">28</span>
one of them, I procured for them a considerable
pleasure; but, in the course of this labour, an abundant
emission on my part caused them great amazement.</p>

<p>“‘Tis its speech,” said I. “The speech of the
great creator of men.”</p>

<p>“‘Tis delicious!” cried Helène, laughing at
the term ‘speech.’</p>

<p>“I, too, have the power of speech,” said Hedvige,
“and I will show it thee, if thou wilt wait a
moment.”</p>

<p>“Put thyself in my hands, sweet Hedvige.
I will spare thee the trouble of making it come thyself,
and I will do it better than thee.”</p>

<p>“I well believe it. But I have never done
that with a man.”</p>

<p>“Nor I,” said Helène.</p>

<p>When they had placed themselves directly
before me, their arms enlaced, I made them swoon
away afresh. Then, having seated ourselves, what
time my hand strayed all over their charms, I let
them divert themselves at their leisure, till in the end
I moistened their palms with a second emission of
the natural moisture, which they examined curiously
on their fingers.</p>

<p>Having once again put ourselves in a state of
decency, we passed yet another half hour in exchanging
kisses, after which I told them that they
had rendered me partially happy, but, to make the
work perfect, that I hoped they would devise a means
of granting me their first favours. Then I showed
them those preservative sachets which the English
have invented in order to rid the fair sex of all fear.<span class="pagenum" id="Page_29">29</span>
These little “purses,”<a id="FNanchor_33" href="#Footnote_33" class="fnanchor">33</a> the use of which I explained
to them, excited their admiration, and Hedvige said
to her cousin that she would give thought to the
matter. Become intimate friends and in good case to
become even better, we took our way towards the
house, where we found Helène’s mother and the
minister walking by the edge of the lake....</p>

<blockquote>

<p><i>Follows now the description of a dinner at
which Casanova, Hedvige and Helène are present.
The text continues:</i></p></blockquote>

<p>Helène shone in solving the questions put to
her by the company. M. de Ximenes begged her to
justify as best she might our first mother, who had
deceived her husband by causing him to eat the fatal
apple.</p>

<p>“Eve,” quoth she, “deceived not her husband;
she did but cajole him into eating it in the hope of
giving him one more perfection. Moreover, Eve had
not received the prohibition from God but from
Adam; in her act there was seduction, not deceit; in
all probability her womanly sense did not let her
regard the prohibition as serious.” ...</p>

<p>... Another lady then asked her if one might
believe the history of the apple to be symbolical.
Hedvige answered:</p>

<p>“I think not, since it could only be a symbol
of sexual union, and ‘tis established that such was
not consummated ‘twixt Adam and Eve in the
Garden of Eden.”</p>

<p>“On this point the learned differ.”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_30">30</span></p>

<p>“So much the worse for them, madam; the
Scripture is plain enough. ‘Tis written in the first
verse of the fourth chapter that Adam knew Eve after
his expulsion from their terrestrial paradise, and that
in consequence she conceived Cain.”</p>

<p>“Yea, but the verse sayeth not that Adam did
not know her before, and, consequently, he might so
have done.”</p>

<p>“This I cannot allow, for had he known her
before she would have conceived; ‘twere foolish to
suppose that two creatures, who had just quitted
God’s hands, and were, in consequence, as nigh perfect
as is possible, could consummate the act of generation
with no result.”</p>

<blockquote>

<p><i>The conversation now becomes very theological
and controversial, and we take leave to omit it.</i></p></blockquote>

<p>... After dinner ... I went apart with
Helène, who told me that her cousin and the pastor
would sup with her mother on the following day.</p>

<p>“Hedvige,” she added, “will stay and sleep
with me, as is ever her custom when she cometh with
her uncle to sup. It remaineth to be seen if thou art
willing to hide in a spot I will show thee to-morrow
at eleven of the clock, in order to pass the night with
us. Call on my mother at that hour to-morrow, and
I will find means of showing thee the spot....”</p>

<p>... In the morning I paid the mother a visit,
and as Helène was escorting me out, she showed me
a closed door ‘twixt the two stairs.</p>

<p>“At seven hours of the clock,” said she, “thou
will find it open, and when thou art within, put on
the bolt. Take care lest any see thee as thou enter
the house.”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_31">31</span></p>

<blockquote>

<p><i>Casanova, in due course, takes up his position
in the hiding place, and during his long wait for the
two charmers, gives himself up to reflection on his
past. The text continues:</i></p></blockquote>

<p>... In my long and profligate career, during
which I have turned the heads of several hundreds of
ladies, I have grown familiar with all methods of seduction;
but it hath ever been my guiding principle
never to press my attack against novices or those in
whom prejudices were likely to prove an obstacle,
save in the presence of another woman. Timidity, I
soon discovered, maketh a girl averse from seduction;
in company with another girl she is easily conquered;
the weakness of one bringeth on the fall of the other.</p>

<p>Fathers and mothers are of contrary opinion,
but they err. They will not trust their daughter to
take a walk or go to a ball with a young man, but no
difficulty is made if she hath another girl with her.
I repeat&mdash;they err; if the young man hath the requisite
skill, their daughter is lost. A sense of false shame
hindereth them from making a determined resistance
to seduction, but, the first step taken, the fall cometh
inevitably and rapidly. One girl, granting some
small favour, straightway maketh her friend grant a
much greater, thereby to hide her own blushes; and
if the seducer be clever at his trade, the youthful
innocent will soon have travelled too far to be able to
draw back. In addition, the more innocent the girl,
the greater her ignorance of seduction’s methods.
Ere she hath time to think, pleasure doth attract her,
curiosity draweth her yet a little further, and opportunity
doth the rest.</p>

<p>For example, ‘twere possible I had been able
to seduce Hedvige without Helène, but I am assured<span class="pagenum" id="Page_32">32</span>
I had never succeeded with Helène had she not seen
her cousin grant me certain licenses what time she
took liberties with me&mdash;practices which she thought,
doubtless, contrary to the modesty and decorum of a
respectable young woman.... I desire what I say
to be a warning to fathers and mothers, and to secure
me a place in their esteem, at any rate.</p>

<p>Shortly after the pastor had gone I heard
three light knocks on my prison door. I opened it,
and a hand soft as satin grasped mine. My whole
being quivered. ‘Twas Helène’s hand, and that
happy moment had already repaid me for my long
waiting.</p>

<p>“Follow me softly,” she said, in a low voice;
but scarce had she closed the door ere I, in my impatience,
clasped her tenderly in my arms, and caused
her to feel the effect which her mere presence had
produced on me, what time I assured myself of her
docility.</p>

<p>“Be prudent, my friend,” said she to me, “and
come softly upstairs.”</p>

<p>I followed her as best I might in the darkness,
she leading me along a gallery into a room without
light, the door of which she closed behind us, and
thence into a lighted chamber, wherein was Hedvige,
well nigh in a state of nudity. She came to me with
open arms on the instant she saw me, and, embracing
me ardently, signified her appreciation of my
patience in my weary prison.</p>

<p>“Divine Hedvige,” quoth I, “had I not loved
thee madly, I had not stayed one fourth of an hour
in that dismal cell; but for thy sake I would readily
pass hours there daily till I quit this spot. But let us
lose no time. To bed!”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_33">33</span></p>

<p>“Do ye twain get to bed,” quoth Helène. “I
will couch on the divan.”</p>

<p>“Oh!” cried Hedvige. “Think not so. Our
fate must be exactly equal.”</p>

<p>“Yea, beloved Helène,” said I, embracing her.
“I love thee both with equal ardour, and these ceremonies
but waste the time wherein I should be convincing
ye of my passion. Follow my example. I
am about to disrobe and place myself in the midst of
the bed. Come lie beside me, and ye will see if I
love ye as ye are worthy to be loved. If all be safe, I
will remain till ye send me away, but whate’er ye do,
of your mercy extinguish not the light.”</p>

<p>In the twinkling of an eye, all the while discussing
the theory of shame with Hedvige the theologian,
I presented myself to their gaze in the costume
of Adam. Hedvige, blushing but fearing, perchance,
to depreciate herself in my opinion by any further
reserve, parted with the last shred of modesty, citing
the opinion of St. Clement Alexandrinus, who held
that in the shirt lay the seat of shame.</p>

<p>I praised unstintingly her charms and the
perfection of her form, thereby hoping to encourage
Helène, who was disrobing but slowly; but a charge
of mock modesty from her cousin had more effect
than all my praises. At length this Venus was in a
state of nature, covering her most secret parts with
one hand, concealing one breast with the other, and
seeming most sadly shamed of all she could not conceal.
Her modest confusion, this strife ‘twixt expiring
modesty and growing passion, enchanted me.</p>

<p>Hedvige was taller than Helène, her skin was
whiter, and her breasts twice the size of her cousin’s;
but in Helène was more animation, her form was<span class="pagenum" id="Page_34">34</span>
more sweetly moulded, and her bust was on the
model of the Venus de Medici.</p>

<p>By degrees she became bolder, put at ease by
her cousin, and we passed several moments in admiring
each other; then to bed we went. Nature
called loudly, and all we desired was to satisfy its
demands. With a coolness that I did not fear would
fail me, I made a woman of Hedvige, and when all
was o’er she kissed me, saying that the pain was
naught compared to the pleasure.</p>

<p>Next came the turn of Helène, who was six
years younger than Hedvige; but the finest “fleece”<a id="FNanchor_34" href="#Footnote_34" class="fnanchor">34</a>
that e’er I saw presented something of an obstacle.
This she parted with her two hands, being jealous of
her cousin’s success; and although she was not initiated
into the mysteries of love without woeful pain,
her sighs were truly sighs of happiness as she responded
to my ardent efforts. Her charms and vivacious
movements caused me to shorten the sacrifice,
and when I quitted the sanctuary my two beauties
perceived I was in need of repose.</p>
<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_35">35</span></p>
<p>The altar was purified of the blood of the victims,
and we all bathed, enchanted to serve one
another.</p>

<p>Life returned to me ‘neath their curious fingers,
and the sight filled them with joy.... For several
hours I overwhelmed them with happiness, passing
five or six times from one to the other before exhausting
myself and arriving at the ecstatic spasm. In the
intervals, perceiving them docile and desirous, I made
them execute Aretin’s most complicated postures, a<span class="pagenum" id="Page_36">36</span>
business that amused them beyond measure.<a id="FNanchor_35" href="#Footnote_35" class="fnanchor">35</a> We
were lavish with our kisses on whatever part took our
fancy, and just as Hedvige applied her lips to the
mouth of the pistol, it went off and the discharge inundated
her face and her bosom. She was delighted,
and studied the eruption to an end with all the
curiosity of a physician.</p>

<p>The night seemed short, though we had not
lost a moment’s space, and at daybreak we had to
part. 1 left them in bed, being fortunate to get away
observed of none.</p>

<blockquote>

<p><i>In the evening, after supper, Casanova contrives
another meeting with his charmers.</i></p></blockquote>

<p>... Going out with my heroines, I worked
wonders. Hedvige philosophised over the pleasure,
and told me that she would ne’er have tasted it had I
not chanced to encounter her uncle. Helène did not
speak; more voluptuous than her cousin, she swelled
out like a dove, and came to life only to expire a
moment after. I wondered at her amazing fecundity,
although such is not uncommon; while I was engaged
in one operation, she passed fourteen times from life
to death. True, ‘twas the sixth course I had run, so I
made my pace somewhat slower to enjoy the pleasure
she took in the business....</p>

<h3><i>EXCURSUS</i> to <i>ADVENTURES WITH HEDVIGE
AND HELÈNE AT GENEVA</i>.</h3>


<p>Jacques Casanova, Chevalier de Seingalt,
Knight of the Golden Spur, and one of the most remarkable
figures in history and letters, was born on
April 2nd, 1725. To-day, nearly two hundred years
afterwards, his <cite>Memoirs</cite> are more vivid and readable
than anything penned by our contemporary writers.</p>

<p>“He who opens these wonderful pages,” says
the English translator in his preface, “is as one who
sits in a theatre and looks across the gloom, not on a
stage-play, but on another and a vanished world.
The curtain draws up, and suddenly a hundred and
fifty years are rolled away, and in bright light stands
out before us the whole life of the past; the gay
dresses, the polished wit, the careless morals, and all
the revel and dancing of those merry years before the
mighty deluge of the Revolution.</p>

<p>“The palaces and marble stairs of old Venice
are no longer desolate, but thronged with scarlet-robed
senators, prisoners with the doom of the Ten
upon their heads cross the Bridge of Sighs, at dead of
night the nun slips out of the convent gate to the dark
canal where a gondola is waiting, we assist at the <i lang="it">parties
fines</i> of cardinals, and we see the bank made at faro.</p>

<p>“Venice gives place to the assembly rooms of<span class="pagenum" id="Page_38">38</span>
Mrs. Cornely and the fast taverns of the London of
1760; we pass from Versailles to the Winter Palace of
St. Petersburg in the days of Catherine, from the
policy of the Great Frederick to the lewd mirth of
strolling-players, and the presence-chamber of the
Vatican is succeeded by an intrigue in a garret.</p>

<p>“It is indeed a new experience to read this
history of a man who, refraining from nothing, has
concealed nothing; of one who stood in the courts of
Louis the Magnificent for Madame de Pompadour and
the nobles of the <i lang="fr">ancien régime</i>, and had an affair
with an adventuress of Denmark Street, Soho; who
was bound over to keep the peace by Fielding, and
knew Cagliostro.</p>

<p>“The friend of popes and kings and noblemen,
and of all the male and female ruffians and
vagabonds of Europe, abbé, soldier, charlatan, gamester,
financier, diplomatist, <i lang="fr">viveur</i>, philosopher, virtuoso,
‘chemist, fiddler, and buffoon’, each of these,
and all of these, was Giacomo Casanova, Chevalier
de Seingalt, Knight of the Golden Spur.”</p>

<p>The English translation of Casanova’s
<cite>Memoirs</cite>, from which the foregoing is taken, is a
valuable work. To-day the twelve volume set, of
which 1,000 copies were privately printed in 1894,
commands anything from thirty to forty-five pounds
in the sale-room or book-seller’s shop. We have been
told that the printer of this English version was prosecuted,
and all copies of the work confiscated by
the police, who were ordered to burn them. Further,
we are told that the copies we buy and read to-day
are the copies burned by the police.</p>

<p>If this be so, all honour to the police, for the
destruction of any scholarly rendering of these<span class="pagenum" id="Page_39">39</span>
<cite>Memoirs</cite> can only be described as an act of vandalism.
Because Casanova is not for the multitude,
does it follow he is not for the few? Translated into
the English tongue, Casanova’s <cite>Memoirs</cite> must be
“privately printed” by reason of his plain speech in
the matter of amorous intrigue, yet, were every erotic
word and scene expunged, the work would still be of
fascinating interest and inestimable value to the
student of history. There exists a bowdlerised and
abridged edition of these <cite>Memoirs</cite>; we have never
seen, and we never wish to see, this work. A study
of life, without a leavening of human nature, is worse
than useless.</p>

<p>Casanova, if any reliance is to be set on his
writings, was a sexual athlete&mdash;a member of that rare
and remarkable class of men who are capable of
amazing feats in the lists of love. Frequent reference
is made to his prowess and observations by the great
sexual psychologists, Havelock Ellis in particular.
Bloch, (<cite>The Sexual Life of Our Time</cite>), quoting from
a work by Oscar A. H. Schmitz, has some interesting
remarks to make on the character of Casanova.</p>

<p>“Casanova,” he says, “is pre-eminently the
erotic, also crafty and deceitful (seducer), not, however,
for the gratification of his need of power, but
rather for the agreeable satisfaction of his need for
sensual love; ... for Casanova each one is ‘the
woman’ ... Casanova is human, cares always for the
happiness of the woman he loves, and devotes to
them a tender reflection; ... Casanova is the typical
feminist, he possesses a profound understanding of
woman’s soul, is not disappointed by love, and needs
for his life’s happiness continuous contact with feminine
natures....”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_40">40</span></p>

<p>“Whatever I have done in the course of my
life,” says Casanova,<a id="FNanchor_36" href="#Footnote_36" class="fnanchor">36</a> “whether it be good or evil, has
been done freely; I am a free agent.... Man is free,
but his freedom ceases when he has no faith in it....
Man is free; yet we must not suppose he is at liberty
to do everything he pleases, for he becomes a slave
the moment he allows his actions to be ruled by his
passions. The man who has sufficient power over
himself to wait until his nature has recovered its even
balance is the truly wise man, but such beings are
seldom met with....</p>

<p>“The sanguine temperament rendered me
very sensible to the attractions of voluptuousness....
The chief business of my life has always been to indulge
my senses; I never knew anything of greater
importance. I felt myself born for the fair sex, I have
ever loved it dearly, and I have been loved by it as
often and as much as I could....</p>

<p>“ ... Should anyone bring against me an accusation
of sensuality he would be wrong, for all the
fierceness of my senses never caused me to neglect
any of my duties.... I have always been fond of
highly-seasoned, rich dishes.... As for women, I have
always found the odour of my beloved ones exceeding
pleasant....</p>

<p>“ ... It may be that certain love scenes will
be considered too explicit, but let no one blame me,
unless it be for lack of skill, for I ought not to be
scolded because, in my old age, I can find no other
enjoyment but that which recollections of the past
afford to me. After all, virtuous and prudish readers
are at liberty to skip over any offensive pictures, and
I think it my duty to give them this piece of advice....</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_41">41</span></p>

<p>“ ... My Memoirs are not written for young
persons who, in order to avoid false steps and slippery
roads, ought to spend their youth in blissful ignorance,
but for those who, having thorough experience
of life, are no longer exposed to temptation, and who,
having but too often gone through the fire, are like
salamanders, and can be scorched by it no more....
I have no hesitation in saying that the really virtuous
are those persons who can practise virtue without the
slightest trouble; such persons are always full of
toleration, and it is to them that my Memoirs are
addressed....”</p>

<p>Casanova, as he himself tells us, was three
score and twelve years when he wrote his <cite>Memoirs</cite>.
The writing, he adds, was both a solace and a
pleasure. Nevertheless, as the English translator
says in his appendix, “the last five years of his life
were passed in petty mortifications.... Death came
to him somewhat as a release. He received the
sacraments with devotion, exclaimed: ‘Great God,
and all ye who witness my death, I have lived a
philosopher and I die a Christian,’ and so died&mdash;a
quiet ending to a wonderfully brilliant and entirely
useless career.”</p>

<h2 title="THE DAMSEL AND THE PRINCE.">THE DAMSEL AND THE PRINCE.<a id="FNanchor_37" href="#Footnote_37" class="fnanchor">37</a></h2>

<p><i>A young lady being enamoured of the Prince
of Salerno sends for one of his chaplains and declares
to him that she has received from the said prince
numerous letters praying for her love. The chaplain,
having divined her motive, enters into a plot with her
and brings the affair to the issue desired.</i></p>


<div>
  <img class="drop-cap" src="images/a.jpg" alt="" />
</div>
<p class="drop-cap">At that time when our most glorious lord and
king, Don Fernando, was entertaining Naples,
according to his constant use, with those
joustings, those marvellous hunting parties,
and those sumptuous festivals which were famed far
and wide, it chanced that amongst the other merry-makers
was a certain young damsel, of beauty almost
unrivalled, and a scion of one of the noblest houses
of our Parthenopean city.</p>

<p>Now for some time past she had often let her
eyes regale themselves with the beauty and the grace
of form belonging to my most illustrious lord, the
Prince of Salerno, and beyond this had heard sung,
over and over again, the praises of his extraordinary
worth. By this time she was more than ever<span class="pagenum" id="Page_43">43</span>
captivated by him, wherefore she became so lovesick
that she could only give thought to the gentleman by
whom her fancy had been ensnared.</p>

<p>After she had let her thoughts ... engage
themselves in many and divers plans by which she
might honourably achieve the victory in so worthy
an adventure, she found that all these schemes were
over-difficult to compass; wherefore it more than
once came into her head that she would follow the
advice of certain other ladies of her acquaintance,
who, whenever they found they could not refrain
from entering the lists of love, were wont to send
word to the gallant youths beloved of them and
challenge them to the amorous warfare.</p>

<p>But this damsel, who was gifted with no
small prudence, and was persuaded at the same time
that she would not, by following such a course, be
setting a very high value either upon herself or upon
her undertaking, suddenly determined that she would
make trial of a novel and very crafty stratagem to
induce the prince aforesaid to cull the first fruits of
her virgin garden. Having chosen a time when the
prince had gone to other parts for diversion in the
chase, she let come to her a certain priest, a man
whom she could fully trust, and one who was much
about the house, and to him she gave directions as to
what she would have him do.</p>

<blockquote>

<p><i>This priest now brings Fra Paulo, the chaplain
and the prince’s most trusted attendant, to the damsel
who alleges the receipt of impassioned love-letters
from the prince. She is at a loss to know whether
these letters have been concocted by one of her
brothers with a view to putting her constancy to proof,
or whether they have really been written by the prince<span class="pagenum" id="Page_44">44</span>
who “is in sooth taken with love of me, seeing that I
have at times kept my eyes fixed upon him somewhat
more than was due.” The text continues</i>:&mdash;</p></blockquote>

<p>With these, and with other words of a like
character, which had been prepared with the most
consummate art, she laid before the chaplain the
letters aforesaid, by way of giving him still farther
assurance of the truth of her craftily devised discourse.
Fra Paulo, although, as a prudent man, and as one
accustomed to bring contests of this sort to a victorious
issue, he had fully detected and comprehended the
hidden wishes and purpose of the young lady,
nevertheless, as she went on step by step with her
reasonings and arguments, was astonished at finding
so great ingenuity and astuteness in the brain of a
damsel so delicate and youthful.</p>

<p>Still, as he remarked more than once that,
whenever she mentioned the name of his lord the
prince, her face changed colour, he understood that
the passion which possessed her must be indeed
burning and fierce. Wherefore he determined to let
this same wind speed his own bark over such a
pleasant sea, and he thus made answer to her:&mdash;</p>

<p>“Lady mine, because of your kindness, you
have thought well enough of me to unveil to me your
secret affairs, you may rest assured that, no less for
the preservation of your own good name than for the
safeguarding of my lord’s, I will deal with this matter
with all that silence and secrecy which, according to
your judgement and mine as well, the gravity and
importance of the same demand....</p>

<p>“ ... I declare once for all that these letters
were never written by my lord; in sooth, if they had
been his handiwork, I should have marvelled amain,<span class="pagenum" id="Page_45">45</span>
because it is his custom never to write with his own
hand to any woman, however fiercely his passion
may be kindled for her, unless he may first have
made proof of her love.... At the outset of all his
love affairs the letters and messages thereanent are
written and arranged by the agency of the chamberlain,
who is in his closest confidence. Wherefore I
hold it for certain that these same letters must be from
the hands of this man....</p>

<p>“ ... Many a time, when I have chanced to
be discoursing concerning the beauty of women with
my lord, he, with a little sigh, which he seemed fain
to repress, has never ceased to place you before all
other ladies. And although his words are rare and
few and sententious, he has full often let me know
secretly that you are the only one to whom he has
entirely given his love.</p>

<p>“Therefore meseems that ... you should
give me authority to act, so I may be able to place the
whole matter together with your own doubts and
fears, before the notice of my lord.... And in order
that you may speedily be informed of the answer,
and that the affair may be kept no long time in suspense,
it will behove you to be on the watch for me,
for when you shall see me pass by your house, and
call to a certain boy who will be standing opposite
thereto, you may be assured that I have done my
errand, and on the following morning let us meet
once more in this same spot.”</p>

<p>The young lady, deeming that she had
assuredly gulled the friar by her trick, and that her
plot could not now fail to come to an issue perfectly
satisfactory to her, was so greatly overjoyed that it
seemed to her as if she had in sooth been crowned by<span class="pagenum" id="Page_46">46</span>
Heaven.... Then, having brought their discourse to
an end, and each one being in a contented mood,
though for a different cause, they went their several
ways.</p>

<p>As Fortune willed it ... the friar was met
by the news that the prince had already taken the
road with the intention of being in Naples on the
following day. Wherefore Fra Paulo, having gone
out to meet him, was mightily glad to let him know
the whole history of the craft of the amorous damsel,
and of the scheme which she had framed. The
prince gave ear to the same with no less amazement
than pleasure; for, albeit he had rarely cast his eyes
upon this young girl, and retained no recollection of
her beauty, nevertheless it seemed to him to be only
just and right that he should hold dear those who
loved him. So he made answer to the friar, and bade
him set the business in progress in such wise that the
meeting might be brought to pass at the earliest
possible time.</p>

<p>The friar, pleased beyond measure and eager
to do service to the prince, betook himself towards the
house of the damsel as soon as he had dismounted
from his beast. Then, having made the sign which
had been agreed between themselves&mdash;a sign which
she observed and understood with the utmost pleasure&mdash;the
damsel duly repaired on the following morning
to the spot which had been chosen; and there, when
she met the friar, he said to her:&mdash;</p>

<p>“My dear lord, who for your pleasure arrived
last night in Naples, commends himself to you. I
have set before him at full length the purport of the
converse betwixt you and me, but I could not draw
from his lips any other reply except that he prays and<span class="pagenum" id="Page_47">47</span>
conjures you, by the perfect love which he has for so
long a time borne and still bears to you, and also by
that love which you should dutifully entertain
towards him, that it will please you, on this same
evening, to give him a kindly audience in order that
he may, without needing to confide in any living
man, lay bare to you those matters which he has kept
hitherto, and still keeps, secured by a strong lock
within his passionate breast.”</p>

<p>The young woman, who, as she listened to
these words, was so vastly overjoyed that she could
with difficulty contain herself within her skin, now
felt that every hour would be as a thousand years
until she should find herself engaged in the supreme
conclusions of love; and, after a few feeble denials
and hesitations, answered that she was ready to do
what the prince desired. She did not quit the friar’s
company until they had, in discreet wise, settled
when and in what manner and in what place she and
the prince should come together for the amorous
battle.</p>

<p>The friar then betook himself straightway to
his beloved lord and prince, who indeed was awaiting
him and his answer. Then he set forth everything to
the prince, who, when himseemed that the appointed
time had come, went with his attendants to the
meeting-place, and there he found the lovely young
damsel, who, delicately arrayed and perfumed,
received him with open arms and exceeding great
delight.</p>

<p>Then, after countless kisses had been given
and received by the prince, they got on board their
bark, and after the helm had been duly set and the
sails spread to the wind, the damsel, what though she<span class="pagenum" id="Page_48">48</span>
was not as yet greatly versed in the mariner’s art, let
her lover navigate the sea of love during all the time
they were able to spend together. When at last they
found themselves with great delight once more in
port, the damsel, tenderly clasping the neck of the
prince with her arms, thus addressed him:&mdash;</p>

<p>“My sweetest lord, for that I alone, aided by
my own skill and forethought, have succeeded in
bringing you hither this first time I have but to thank
myself, but for the future I must leave to the care of
you and of Love the devising of the means whereby
you may be able to show me further proofs of your
passion. Now there remains nothing more for me to
say except that I recommend myself without ceasing
to your favour.”</p>

<p>Thereupon the illustrious lord the prince
heartened her with soft and tender words, and they
then took leave of one another with great pleasure
and delight; and if anyone should still wish to know
whether, and in what fashion, this love of theirs bore
further fruit, let him inquire on his own behalf.</p>

<h3><i>EXCURSUS</i> to <i>THE DAMSEL AND THE
PRINCE</i>.</h3>

<p>Because Masuccio&mdash;so far as the general
public is concerned&mdash;may be counted among the
lesser-known of the Novellieri of the Cinquecento, it
may not be inappropriate to give a few details of his
life and work. To this purpose we cannot do better
than quote from the admirable introduction to Mr. W.
G. Waters’ translation of the <cite>Novellino</cite>, whence is
taken our story of <i>The Damsel and the Prince</i>.</p>

<p>Masuccio, says Mr. Waters, “was probably
born about 1420.... Seeing that he was Sanseverino’s
secretary, and that the great majority of his novels
are dedicated to prominent Neapolitans, it may be
assumed that his life was chiefly spent in Naples and
the neighbourhood.... After 1474 Masuccio fades
entirely from view....</p>

<p>“Masuccio seems to have rated himself as one
with a message to deliver ... his phraseology gives
one the impression that he wrote with his feelings at
white heat.... In the very Prologue to the work he
announces his primary theme, by proclaiming himself
the scourger of priestly vices.... If the words
which a man speaks or writes are ever to be taken as
evidence of the mind that is in him, then assuredly
Masuccio may be credited with ardent hatred of<span class="pagenum" id="Page_50">50</span>
the offences he denounces.<a id="FNanchor_38" href="#Footnote_38" class="fnanchor">38</a> Putting aside occasional
lapses into licentiousness of expression as accidents
inseparable from the age in which he wrote, it is
almost impossible to doubt his sincerity as a would-be
reformer of manners....</p>

<p>“ ... Masuccio’s canvas is a limited one.
A few of his stories are in the vein of genuine buffo,
a few more are tragedies pure and simple, but the
majority of the residue will be found to treat of one
or other of his two particular themes, the castigation
of profligate clerics and unchaste women. He
devotes one part of the work to each of these specially;
but in the other parts he never lets a friar or a woman
escape the lash if he finds the chance of laying it on.</p>

<p>“The most scathing passages ... are those
which occur here and there in the ‘Masuccio’ at the
end of his stories.... As an instance may be quoted
the conclusion to Novel XXIII., in which, after
screaming himself hoarse over the crimes of women,
he finishes with these words:&mdash;</p>

<p>“‘Would that it had been God’s pleasure and
Nature’s to have suffered us to be brought forth from
the oak-trees, or indeed to have been engendered
from water and mire like the frogs in the humid rains
of summer, rather than to have taken our origin from
so base, so corrupt, and so vilely fashioned a sex as
womankind.’”</p>

<p>As a further example of Masuccio’s hatred
of women, Mr. Waters cites “the frightful indictment<span class="pagenum" id="Page_51">51</span>
at the end of Novel VI. which he prefers against
women who put on the habit of religious houses.”
We might do worse than quote it:&mdash;</p>

<p>“ ... I keep silence, likewise, concerning
all that might be said on the subject of the marriage
of these women with friars ... how they make
sumptuous marriage feasts, inviting thereto from this
convent and that their friends, who present themselves
with equipages laden with all manner of rich
goods.... With the consent of the abbess and of
their prelate they execute marriage contracts, duly
written and sealed; and then, having supped off all
manner of sumptuous meats, and performed every
other ceremony pertaining to the rite of marriage,
they go to bed one with another without showing
any fear or shame, just as if their union had been
contracted with the full sanction of their own fathers,
and by the laws of marriage....”<a id="FNanchor_39" href="#Footnote_39" class="fnanchor">39</a></p>

<p>Space will not permit us, however, to deal <i lang="la">in
extenso</i> with Masuccio’s hatred of priest and woman.
We can best refer the reader to his <cite>Novellino</cite>, or to
such extracts as we shall make from them in subsequent
volumes of <em>Anthologica Rarissima</em>. Our
purpose, in the foregoing sketch, was to give some
slight impression of the aims and mentality of the
author of the two stories reproduced in this particular
volume.</p>

<h2 title="BEYOND THE MARK.">BEYOND THE MARK.<a id="FNanchor_41" href="#Footnote_41" class="fnanchor">41</a></h2>

<p><i>Of a shepherd who made an agreement with a
shepherdess that he should mount upon her “in order
that he might see farther,” but was not to penetrate
beyond a mark which she herself made with her hand
upon the instrument of the said shepherd&mdash;as will
more plainly appear hereafter.</i></p>


<div>
  <img class="drop-cap" src="images/l.jpg" alt="" />
</div>
<p class="drop-cap">Listen, an it please ye, to what happened, near
Lille, to a shepherd and a young shepherdess
who tended their flocks together, or near
together.</p>

<p>Nature had already stirred in them, and they
were of an age to know “the way of the world,” so one
day an agreement was made between them that the
shepherd should mount on the shepherdess “in order
to see farther,”<a id="FNanchor_42" href="#Footnote_42" class="fnanchor">42</a>&mdash;provided, however, that he should
not penetrate beyond a mark which she made with
her hand upon the natural instrument of the shepherd,
and which was about two fingers’ breadth below the<span class="pagenum" id="Page_54">54</span>
head; and the mark was made with a blackberry
taken from the hedge.</p>

<p>That being done, they began God’s work,
and the shepherd pushed in as though it had cost him
no trouble, and without thinking about any mark or
sign, or the promise he had made to the shepherdess,
for all that he had it buried up to the hilt, and if he
had had more he would have found a place to put it.</p>

<p>The pretty shepherdess, who had never had
such a wedding, enjoyed herself so much that she
would willingly have done nothing else all her life.
The battle being ended, both went to look after their
sheep, which had meanwhile strayed some distance.
They being brought together again, the shepherd,
who was called Hacquin, to pass the time, sat in a
swing set up between two hedges, and there he
swung, as happy as a king.</p>

<p>The shepherdess sat by the side of a ditch,
and made a wreath of flowers. She sang a little song,
hoping that it would attract the shepherd, and he
would begin the game over again; but that was very
far from his thoughts. When she found he did not
come, she began to call: “Hacquin! Hacquin!”</p>

<p>And he replied: “What wantest thou?”</p>

<p>“Come hither! Come hither! Wilt thou?”
said she.</p>

<p>But Hacquin had had a surfeit of pleasure
and made answer:</p>

<p>“In God’s name, leave me alone. I do naught.
I enjoy myself.”</p>

<p>Then the shepherdess cried:</p>

<p>“Come hither, Hacquin; I will let thee go in
further, without making any mark.”</p>

<p>“By St. John,” said Hacquin, “I went far<span class="pagenum" id="Page_55">55</span>
beyond the mark, and I do not want any more.”</p>

<p>He would not go to the shepherdess, who
was much vexed to have to remain idle.<a id="FNanchor_43" href="#Footnote_43" class="fnanchor">43</a></p>

<h2 title="THE DEVIL IN HELL.">THE DEVIL IN HELL.<a id="FNanchor_44" href="#Footnote_44" class="fnanchor">44</a></h2>


<div>

</div>
<p class="drop-cap">In the city of Capsa in Barbary there was
aforetime a very rich man, who, among his
other children, had a fair and winsome
young daughter, by name Alibech. She, not
being a Christian and hearing many Christians who
abode in the town mightily extol the Christian faith
and the service of God, one day questioned one of
them in what manner one might avail to serve God
with the least hindrance. The other answered that
they best served God who most strictly eschewed the
things of the world, as those did who had betaken
them into the solitudes of the deserts of Thebaïs.</p>

<p>The girl, who was maybe fourteen years old
and very simple, moved by no ordered desire, but by
some childish fancy, set off next morning by stealth
and all alone, to go to the desert of Thebaïs without
letting any know her intent.</p>

<p>After some days, her desire persisting, she
won, with no little toil, to the deserts in question and
seeing a hut afar off, went thither and found at the
door a holy man, who marvelled to see her there and
asked her what she sought. She replied that, being
inspired of God, she went seeking to enter into His<span class="pagenum" id="Page_57">57</span>
service and was now in quest of one who should
teach her how it behoved to serve Him.</p>

<p>The worthy man, seeing her young and very
fair and fearing lest, an he entertained her, the devil
should beguile him, commended her pious intent and
giving her somewhat to eat of roots and herbs and
wild apples and dates and to drink of water, said to
her:</p>

<p>“Daughter mine, not far hence is a holy man,
who is a much better master than I of that which thou
goest seeking; do thou betake thyself to him;” and
put her in the way. However, when she reached the
man in question, she had of him the same answer
and faring farther, came to the cell of a young hermit,
a very devout and good man, whose name was Rustico
and to whom she made the same request as she had
done to the others.</p>

<p>He, having a mind to make a trial of his own
constancy, sent her not away, as the others had done,
but received her into his cell, and the night being
come, he made her a little bed of palm-fronds and
bade her lie down to rest thereon.</p>

<p>This done, temptations tarried not to give
battle to his powers of resistance and he, finding
himself grossly deceived by these latter, turned tail,
without many assaults, and confessed himself beaten;
then, laying aside devout thoughts and orisons and
mortifications, he fell to revolving in his memory the
youth and beauty of the damsel and bethinking himself
what course he should take with her, so as to win
to that which he desired of her, without her taking
him for a debauched fellow.</p>

<p>Accordingly, having sounded her with sundry
questions, he found that she had never known<span class="pagenum" id="Page_58">58</span>
man and was in truth as simple as she seemed;
wherefore he bethought him, how, under colour of
the service of God, he might bring her to his
pleasures. In the first place, he showed her with
many words how great an enemy the devil was of
God the Lord and after gave her to understand that
the most acceptable service that could be rendered to
God was to put back the devil in hell, whereto He
had condemned him. The girl asked him how this
might be done; and he, “Thou shalt soon know that;
do thou but as thou shalt see me do.” So saying, he
proceeded to put off the few garments he had and
abode stark naked, as likewise did the girl, whereupon
he fell on his knees, as he would pray, and caused
her abide over against himself.</p>

<p>Matters standing thus and Rustico being more
than ever inflamed in his desires to see her so fair,
there came the resurrection of the flesh, which
Alibech observing and marvelling:</p>

<p>“Rustico,” quoth she, “What is that I see on
thee which thrusteth forth thus and which I have
not?”</p>

<p>“Faith, daughter mine,” answered he, “this is
the devil whereof I bespoke thee; and see now, he
giveth me such sore annoy that I can scarce put up
with it.”</p>

<p>Then said the girl:</p>

<p>“Now praised be God! I see I fare better
than thou, in that I have none of yonder devil.”</p>

<p>“True,” rejoined Rustico; “but thou hast
overwhat that I have not, and thou hast it instead of
this.”</p>

<p>“What is that?” asked Alibech; and he:</p>

<p>“Thou hast hell, and I tell thee methinketh<span class="pagenum" id="Page_59">59</span>
God hath sent thee hither for my soul’s health, for
that, whenas this devil doth me this annoy, an it
please thee have so much compassion on me as to
suffer me put him back into hell, thou wilt give the
utmost solacement and wilt do God a very great
pleasure and service, so indeed thou be come into
these parts to do as thou sayest.”</p>

<p>The girl answered in good faith:</p>

<p>“Marry, father mine, since I have hell, be it
whensoever it pleaseth thee;” whereupon quoth
Rustico:</p>

<p>“Daughter, blessed be thou; let us go then
and put him back there, so he may after leave me in
peace.”</p>

<p>So saying, he laid her on one of their little
beds and taught her how she should do to imprison
that accursed one of God. The girl, who had never
yet put any devil in hell, for the first time felt some
little pain; wherefore she said to Rustico:</p>

<p>“Certes, father mine, this same devil must be
an ill thing and an enemy in very deed of God, for
that it irketh hell itself, let be otherwhat, when he is
put back therein.”</p>

<p>“Daughter,” answered Rustico, “it will not
always happen thus;” and to the end that this should
not happen, six times, or ever they stirred from the
bed, they put him in hell again, insomuch that for the
nonce they so took the conceit out of his head that he
willingly abode at peace. But, it returning to him
again and again the ensuing days and the obedient
girl still lending herself to take it out of him, it befell
that the sport began to please her and she said to
Rustico:</p>

<p>“I see now that those good people in Capsa<span class="pagenum" id="Page_60">60</span>
spoke sooth, when they avouched that it was so sweet
a thing to serve God; for certes, I remember me not
to have ever done aught that afforded me such pleasance
and delight as putting the devil in hell; wherefore
methinketh that whoso applieth himself unto
aught other than God His service is a fool.”</p>

<p>Accordingly, she came ofttimes to Rustico
and said to him:</p>

<p>“Father mine, I came here to serve God and
not to abide idle; let us go put the devil in hell.”
Which doing, she said whiles:</p>

<p>“Rustico, I know not why the devil fleeth
away from hell; for, an he abode there as willingly
as hell receiveth him and holdeth him, he would
never come forth therefrom.”</p>

<p>The girl, then, on this wise often inviting
Rustico and exhorting him to the service of God, so
took the bombast out of his doublet that he felt cold
what time another had sweated; wherefore he fell to
telling her that the devil was not to be chastised nor
put into hell, save whenas he should lift up his head
for pride.</p>

<p>“And we,” added he, “by God’s grace, have
so baffled him that he prayeth our Lord to suffer him
abide in peace;” and on this wise he for awhile imposed
silence on her.</p>

<p>However, when she saw that he required her
not of putting the devil in hell, she said to him one
day:</p>

<p>“Rustico, an thy devil be chastened and give
thee no more annoy, my hell letteth me not be;
wherefore thou wilt do well to aid me with thy devil
in abating the raging of my hell, even as with my hell
I have helped thee take the conceit out of thy devil.”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_61">61</span></p>

<p>Rustico, who lived on roots and water, could
ill avail to answer her calls and told her that it would
need overmany devils to appease hell, but he would
do what he might thereof. Accordingly he satisfied
her bytimes, but so seldom it was but casting a bean
into the lion’s mouth; whereat the girl, herseeming
she served not God as diligently as she would fain
have done, murmured somewhat.</p>

<p>But, whilst this debate was toward between
Rustico his devil and Alibech her hell, for overmuch
desire on the one part and lack of power on the other,
it befell that a fire broke out in Capsa and burnt
Alibech’s father in his own house, with as many
children and other family as he had; by reason
whereof she abode heir to all his good.</p>

<p>Thereupon, a young man called Nëerbale,
who had spent all his substance in gallantry, hearing
that she was alive, set out in search of her and finding
her, before the court (<i>i.e.</i>, the government) had laid
hands upon her father’s estate, as that of a man dying
without heir, to Rustico’s great satisfaction, but against
her own will, brought her back to Capsa, where he
took her to wife and succeeded, in her right, to the
ample inheritance of her father.</p>

<p>There, being asked by the women at what
she served God in the desert, she answered (Nëerbale
having not yet lain with her) that she served Him at
putting the devil in hell and that Nëerbale had done
a grievous sin in that he had taken her from such
service.</p>

<p>The ladies asked:</p>

<p>“How putteth one the devil in hell?”</p>

<p>And the girl, what with words and what with
gestures, expounded it to them; whereat they set up<span class="pagenum" id="Page_62">62</span>
so great a laughing that they laugh yet and said:</p>

<p>“Give yourself no concern, my child; nay,
for that is done here also and Nëerbale will serve our
Lord full well with thee at this.”</p>

<p>Thereafter, telling it from one to another
throughout the city, they brought it to a common
saying there that the most acceptable service one
could render to God was to put the devil in hell,
which byword, having passed the sea hither, is yet
current here. Wherefore do all you young ladies,
who have need of God’s grace, learn to put the devil
in hell, for that this is highly acceptable to Him and
pleasing to both parties and much good may grow
and ensue thereof.</p>

<h3><i>EXCURSUS</i> to <i>THE DEVIL IN HELL</i>.</h3>


<p>Boccaccio’s immortal story of Alibech who
“turned hermit and was taught by Rustico, a monk,
to put the devil in hell” has been drawn upon or
brazenly copied by innumerable <i lang="fr">raconteurs</i>. La
Fontaine has an exactly similar story. “To put the
devil in hell” has passed into use as an accepted slang
term for the act of copulation. <em>Hell</em>, in English, and
<i lang="fr">Enfer</i> in French, are erotic synonyms for the female
<i lang="la">pudendum</i>, as are <em>devil</em> and <i lang="fr">diable</i> for the male organ
of generation. (<cite>C.f.</cite> Farmer: <cite>Slang and its Analogues</cite>
and <cite>Vocabula Amatoria</cite>; also Landes: <cite>Glossaire
érotique de la langue française</cite>.) “Vainly doth hell
her prisoner recall,” says La Fontaine; “the devil is
dumb.”</p>

<p>It is a moot point whether “The Devil in Hell”
should have been included in this or the subsequent
volume, <cite>The Way of a Priest</cite>. It seems to us, however,
that the woman’s part transcends the man’s
throughout, and for that reason we prefer to look upon
the story as illustrating a phase of virginity rather
than as an example of priestly lust.</p>

<p>Boccaccio’s “Nightingale,” which is also
given in this volume, has provided yet another French
slang term for the <i lang="la">penis</i>. “To put the nightingale in
its cage or nest” is a fanciful but frequent description
of the venereal act. (<i>C.f.</i> Pietro Aretino’s <cite>Dialogues</cite>:<span class="pagenum" id="Page_64">64</span>
1. <cite>The Life of Nuns</cite>: English and French translations:
Liseux, Paris, 1889 and 1882.) On the other hand,
<em>nightingale</em>, in old English slang, denoted a prostitute.
(Farmer: <cite>Slang and its Analogues</cite>.)</p>

<p>The inclusion of any of Boccaccio’s tales in
this volume has not gone uncritised by friends and
advisers. “<cite>The Decameron</cite>,” they argue, “is accessible
to all; it is hackneyed nowadays.” If the frequent
issue of cheap, castrated and badly-produced editions
of the immortal work are these so-called means of
access, the argument is a poor one.</p>

<p>Boccaccio, to be appreciated, must be read in
the original, unexpurgated Italian, or, at any rate, in
a translation which is equally free and is the work of
a scholar and booklover. Some of Boccaccio’s stories
are fitly classed as the world’s best, and among these
“The Devil in Hell” takes place. It is a story that has
lived for centuries and will live while literature lasts.</p>

<p>Further, so far as we know, in one English
translation alone, Payne’s, (<i lang="la">vide</i> note <i lang="la">ante</i>, <a href="#Page_56">p. 56</a>), is
this story told in its entirety in our own language; in
other editions the most dramatic part of the narrative,
the part, in fact, which <em>makes</em> the story, is invariably
rendered in Italian or French, or is hopelessly bowdlerised.
Thus is prudery satisfied and genius mocked.
“The Devil in Hell” is strong fare assuredly, but it is
served up in so artistic a manner as to please even
the most delicate palate.</p>

<p class="drop-cap">“Mother mine,” quoth Jean the Fool, “I would
marry.”</p>

<p>“Thou wouldst marry, poor innocent?
And what wouldst thou do with a woman?
And who would want thee? To marry, thou must
have culture at thy back (for thus they term those
who have worldly goods), and thou hast none. Furthermore,
thou must pay court to the maidens, and
thou art too great a fool to know how to do that.”</p>

<p>“What doth one do when he goeth to visit
the maidens?”</p>

<p>“One goeth to them when they hold a party,
one indulgeth in all manner of drolleries, one pincheth
them, one snatcheth their handkerchiefs when
they blow their noses, one pulleth at their petticoats,
and one laugheth.”</p>

<p>“Good,” said Jean to himself; and went out.</p>

<p>Passing down a road, narrow and filled with
mire, he sat down, and when he felt he had sufficient
‘cultivation’ on his backside, he went to a farm where
there was a party. The youths and maidens, when
they saw Jean the Idiot enter all smeared with mire,
drew back to make room for him, lest they themselves<span class="pagenum" id="Page_66">66</span>
be soiled. In the end he found in the lobby a
stool on which he sat near one of the maidens, whom
he scrutinised closely.</p>

<p>She drew away from him; Jean pinched her,
rudely snatched away her handkerchief when she
sought to make use of it, and laughed like a fool.
Then, thinking to succeed with her, he tugged so
violently at her petticoat that he broke the strings that
held it up. The maiden, half undressed, was enraged,
and Jean was kicked out of doors, amid the shouting
and jeering of the entire company.</p>

<p>From this moment Jean the Fool had no desire
to pay court to maidens. But his mother, who felt
herself growing old and had need of a daughter-in-law
to aid her, said to him one day:</p>

<p>“Jean, thou must marry.”</p>

<p>“Nay, indeed, mother mine. I was tricked
enough when I saw the maidens.”</p>

<p>“Nevertheless, ‘tis good to be married. Thy
wife will give thee a chicken to eat.”<a id="FNanchor_46" href="#Footnote_46" class="fnanchor">46</a></p>

<p>Jean gave his consent and was married.
When he was abed with his wife, he believed that
she would serve up a chicken for him, and he said to
her:</p>

<p>“Give it me.”</p>

<p>“Take it,” answered his wife.</p>

<p>“Give it me, I tell thee.”</p>

<p>“Take it, then.”</p>

<p>Thus passed the night, and on the morrow<span class="pagenum" id="Page_67">67</span>
Jean the Fool went weeping to his mother, saying:</p>

<p>“Mother, I begged her for it, and she would
not give it me.”</p>

<p>“He lieth!” cried the wife. “I have told him
to take it if he wished it.”</p>

<p>And she went to complain to her mother that
she had married an idiot, who passed the whole night
saying “Give it me” without doing aught else. The
good woman saw clearly that her son-in-law was
foolish, and she bade him on the following night
mount upon his wife and thrust at a spot where he
felt some hair.</p>

<p>Jean did as he was counselled, but instead of
stretching himself at full length upon her, laid himself
across his wife and began to thrust with all his
force, but without success, as one can well imagine, a
woman’s slit not being at the same angle as her
mouth.</p>

<p>Nor was it until the third night that Jean the
Fool learned how he must comport himself to have a
chicken, and then he found it very much to his taste
and his wife also.<a id="FNanchor_47" href="#Footnote_47" class="fnanchor">47</a></p>

<h2 title="THE MAIDEN WELL GUARDED.">THE MAIDEN WELL GUARDED.<a id="FNanchor_48" href="#Footnote_48" class="fnanchor">48</a></h2>


<div>
  <img class="drop-cap" src="images/t.jpg" alt="" />
</div>
<p class="drop-cap">There lived a maiden whose mother guarded
her with infinite care lest some youth should
do her ill; and she was brought up in all
innocence. And when she begged to go to
gatherings even as other maids of her age, her mother
was wont to answer her, saying:</p>

<p>“Nay, my daughter, thou shalt not go, for
there thou art like to lose thy maidenhead.”</p>

<p>One day, nevertheless, Pierre, the maiden’s
lover, who was a good lad and a quiet, came seeking
to conduct her to an assembly, and both lad and maid
besought the mother to let them go. In the end she
consented, thinking in herself that Pierre was too
honest to do her daughter ill, and she enjoined him
guard her well.</p>

<p>Behold, then, these two on their way; and as
they went, the maiden said:</p>

<p>“My mother hath strictly enjoined me to
guard my maidenhead. It seemeth that at assemblies
one is in case to lose it. How best preserve it?”</p>

<p>“Hath not thy mother shown thee a method
of so doing?”</p>

<p>“Yea,” answered the maiden, “she hath en<span class="pagenum" id="Page_70">70</span>joined
me to press my thighs tightly together.”</p>

<p>Quitting the road, they entered a wood
wherein were several streamlets, which one crossed by
means of planks. Even as the maid walked upon one
of these planks Pierre, who marched behind her, cast
a stone into the water hard by the girl.</p>

<p>“Alas!” cried the maiden. “What will my
mother say? Behold, my maidenhead hath fallen in
the water and is lost!”</p>

<p>“Fear not,” answered the lad. “‘Tis fortunate
I am here. I will restore it thee. Come with me
‘neath the trees, and say naught if the business
hurteth thee, for ‘tis all for thy good.”</p>

<p>Then Pierre, in very sooth, ‘put back’ the
maidenhead for her, and shortly afterward they came
to the second plank. Even as the girl stood upon it,
two or three frogs, slumbering at the streamside, were
affrighted and hopped into the water, which spirted
up ‘neath the maiden.</p>

<p>“Ah! Pierre!” cried she. “‘Tis lost again!
It seemeth that it was not firm. ‘Twas most wrong of
thee not to have put it back more firmly.”</p>

<p>“Say no more,” answered Pierre. “I will again
put it back.”</p>

<p>And when the maidenhead had been put
back for the second time, they went on, reaching the
assembly, where they diverted themselves as did the
others.</p>

<p>On their return journey, even as the young
girl passed over a plank, Pierre cast in the water an
apple which he had in his pocket.</p>

<p>“What will my mother say?” cried the girl.
“‘Tis the third time I have lost it to-day!”</p>

<p>“Fear not,” quoth Pierre. “I am about to sew<span class="pagenum" id="Page_71">71</span>
it on again.”</p>

<p>When the maidenhead had been resewed,
the girl, who was acquiring a taste for this form of
embroidery, said to Pierre:</p>

<p>“‘Tis not sewn sufficiently firm.”</p>

<p>“Indeed it is.”</p>

<p>“‘Tis not.”</p>

<p>“But I have no more thread.”</p>

<p>“Miserable deceiver!” cried the girl. “He
saith he hath no more thread, yet all the while he
possesseth two great balls of it!”<a id="FNanchor_49" href="#Footnote_49" class="fnanchor">49</a></p>

<h3><i>VARIANT.</i></h3>


<p>Béroalde de Verville, in <cite>Le Moyen de
Parvenir</cite>, has a similar tale. As it differs in several
respects from our <cite>Kruptadia</cite> version, we give it here.
Our extract is from Arthur Machen’s text, which
is, so far as we know, the only English translation
of the old French Canon’s much censured work.<a id="FNanchor_50" href="#Footnote_50" class="fnanchor">50</a>
Donatus, one of the characters in the book, is
speaking:&mdash;</p>

<p>... That’s like the case of my landlady’s
daughter.... One day this young wench desired
to go to a bride-ale, and asked leave of her mother,
who granted it on the condition that she would
solemnly, paragraphically, and distinctively promise
to keep her maidenhead,<a id="FNanchor_51" href="#Footnote_51" class="fnanchor">51</a> to which condition the
girl agreed with all her heart.</p>

<p>So she went away to the wedding, and set
herself to keep guard o’er her maidenhead. The
lasses and lads all danced away, but she not a step,
nor did she dare approach the board where the others
were engaged in the quintessential operation of
making ordure with the teeth. The poor girl stayed
all the time in a corner of the room, with her two
hands at the bottom of her stomach, just opposite to<span class="pagenum" id="Page_73">73</span>
the diameter (I mean opposite to the centre which so
far was cut by no diameter). Coypeau, seeing her
thus dung in the mouth (I should say, down in the
mouth) came up to her and said:</p>

<p>“What cheer, Coz; shall we foot it awhile?”</p>

<p>“Nay, I dare not, for fear I lose my maidenhead;
my mother bade me take great care of it.”</p>

<p>“Oh, Oh,” says he, “and is that all? Why
Coz, sweet Coz, follow me to this little closet, and I’ll
sew it up so tight that it shall never fall out.”</p>

<p>All this he said in a whisper, but she heard
him well enough, for she was fain to be a-dancing;
and so she followed him. He then proceeded to
show her how the wolf dances with his tail between
his legs, and sewed up her maidenhead so securely
that he told her it would never fall out by that way.</p>

<p>Thereupon she began to dance, and enjoyed
herself to her heart’s content; but she liked needlework
so well that she asked for some more, and had
three stitches. (That was enough in all conscience,
though I have threaded the needle<a id="FNanchor_52" href="#Footnote_52" class="fnanchor">52</a> for Madeleine
forty-five times in forty-four hours; five by night
and by day <i lang="fr">forté</i>.) Coypeau was not quite so strong
as that, but he gave the poor girl a great treat. She ate
some sweetmeats, and feeling ashamed no longer,
bethought her of her maidenhead, and went up to him,
and asked him if he would give it another stitch.</p>

<p>“Faith! “ said he, “I can’t, I haven’t any more
thread.”</p>

<p>“Come, Come,” quoth she, “I thought I saw
two nice little balls of thread.”</p>

<h2 title="TALE OF KAMAR AL-ZAMAN.">TALE OF KAMAR AL-ZAMAN.<a id="FNanchor_53" href="#Footnote_53" class="fnanchor">53</a></h2>


<p><i>King Shahriman had a son, Kamar al-Zaman,
who “grew up of surpassing beauty ... and symmetry,”
but was unwilling to marry. For this he is eventually
cast into prison. A similar fate has befallen Princess
Budur, daughter of King Ghayur, Lord of China Islands
and Seas, and for a similar reason. The maiden is
pictured as one “than whom Allah hath made none
fairer in her time ... with cheeks like purple wine ...
lips as coral ... breasts like two globes of ivory, from
whose brightness the moons borrow light, and a stomach
with little waves as it were a figured cloth ... with creases
like folded scrolls, ending in a waist slender past all
imagination; based upon back parts like a hillock of
blown sand, that force her to sit when she would lief
stand....”</i></p>

<p><i>Two genii, Maymunah, a woman, and Dahnash,
a man, now come into the story, the former as a champion
of Kamar, the latter as Princess Budur’s. After
a long dispute as to the rival charms of Prince and<span class="pagenum" id="Page_75">75</span>
Princess, they convey the latter to the Prince’s side,
the test of beauty to be as follows</i>:&mdash;</p>

<p><i>Each is to be awakened in turn, without
knowledge of the other, and whichever is the more
enamoured will be held inferior in comeliness.</i></p>

<p><i>Dahnash then changes himself into a flea,
and bites Kamar al-Zaman, who wakes up. The text
continues</i>:&mdash;</p>


<p>... Then turning sideways, he found lying
by him something whose breath was sweeter than
musk and whose skin was softer than cream. Hereat
he marvelled with great marvel, and he sat up and
looked at what lay beside him; when he saw it to be
a young lady like an union pearl, or a shining sun, or
a dome seen from afar on a well-built wall: for she
was five feet tall ... bosomed high and rosy-cheeked....</p>

<p>And when Kamar al-Zaman saw the lady
Budur, daughter of King Ghayur, and her beauty and
comeliness, she was sleeping clad in a shift of Venetian
silk, without her petticoat trousers, and wore on
her head a kerchief embroidered with gold and set
with stones of price; her ears were hung with twin
earrings which shone like constellations, and round
her neck was a collar of union pearls, of size unique,
past the competence of any king.</p>

<p>When he saw this, his reason was confounded
and natural heat began to stir in him; Allah awoke
in him the desire of coïtion and he said to himself:</p>

<p>“Whatso Allah willeth, that shall be, and
what he willeth not shall be!”</p>

<p>So saying, he put out his hand, turning her
over, loosed the collar of her chemise; then arose
before his sight her bosom, with its breasts like double<span class="pagenum" id="Page_76">76</span>
globes of ivory; whereat his inclination for her redoubled
and he desired her with exceeding hot desire.
He would have awakened her but she would not
awake, for Dahnash had made her sleep heavy; so he
shook her and moved her, saying:</p>

<p>“O my beloved, awake and look on me; I am
Kamar al-Zaman.”</p>

<p>But she awoke not, neither moved her head;
whereupon he considered her case for a long hour
and said to himself:</p>

<p>“If I guess aright, this is the damsel to whom
my father would have married me, and these three
years I have refused her; but Inshallah!&mdash;God willing&mdash;as
soon as it is dawn, I will say to him: Marry me
to her, that I may enjoy her; nor will I let half the
day pass ere I possess her and take my fill of her
beauty and loveliness.”</p>

<p>Then he bent over Budur to buss her, whereat
the Jinniyah Maymunah trembled and was abashed
and Dahnash, the Ifrit, was like to fly for joy. But
as Kamar al-Zaman was about to kiss her on the
mouth, he was ashamed before Allah and turned
away his head and averted his face, saying to his
heart: “Have patience.”</p>

<p>Then he took thought awhile and said:</p>

<p>“I will be patient; haply my father when he
was wroth with me and sent me to this jail, may have
brought my young lady and made her lie by my side
to try me with her, and may have charged her not to
be readily awakened when I would arouse her, and
may have said to her:</p>

<p>“‘Whatever thing Kamar al-Zaman do to thee,
make me ware thereof’;</p>

<p>“Or belike my sire standeth hidden in some<span class="pagenum" id="Page_77">77</span>
stead whence (being himself unseen) he can see all I
do with this young lady; and to-morrow he will scold
me and cry:</p>

<p>“‘How cometh it that thou sayest, I have no
mind to marry; and yet thou didst kiss and embrace
yonder damsel?’</p>

<p>“So I will withhold myself lest I be ashamed
before my sire; and the right and proper thing to do
is not to touch her at this present, nor even to look
upon her, except to take from her somewhat which
shall serve as a token to me and a memorial of her;
that some sign endure between me and her.”</p>

<p>Then Kamar al-Zaman raised the young
lady’s hand and took from her little finger a seal-ring
worth an immense amount of money, for that its
bezel was a precious jewel ... and set it on his own;
then, turning his back to her, went to sleep.<a id="FNanchor_54" href="#Footnote_54" class="fnanchor">54</a> ...</p>

<p>Thereupon Maymunah changed herself into
a flea and entering into the raiment of Budur, the
loved of Dahnash, crept up her calf and came upon
her thigh and, reaching a place some four carats<a id="FNanchor_55" href="#Footnote_55" class="fnanchor">55</a>
below her navel, there bit her. Thereupon she
opened her eyes and sitting up in bed, saw a youth
lying beside her and breathing heavily in his sleep,
the loveliest of Almighty Allah’s creatures, with eyes
that put to shame the fairest Houris of Heaven; and
a mouth like Solomon’s seal, whose water was sweeter
to the taste and more efficacious than a theriack, and
lips the colour of coral-stone, and cheeks like blood-red anemone....</p>
<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_78">78</span></p>
<p>Now when Princess Budur saw him, she was
seized by a transport of passion and yearning and
love-longing, and she said to herself:</p>

<p>“Alas, my shame! This is a strange youth
and I know him not. How cometh he to be lying by
my side on one bed?”</p>

<p>Then she looked at him a second time and,
noting his beauty and loveliness, said:</p>

<p>“By Allah, he is indeed a comely youth and
my heart is well-nigh torn in sunder with longing
for him! But alas, how am I shamed by him! By
the Almighty, had I known it was this youth who
sought me in marriage of my father, I had not rejected
him, but had wived with him and enjoyed his loveliness!”</p>

<p>Then she gazed in his face and said:</p>

<p>“O my lord and light of mine eyes, awake
from sleep and take thy pleasure in my beauty and
grace.”</p>

<p>And she moved him with her hand; but
Maymunah the Jinniyah let down sleep upon him as
it were a curtain, and pressed heavily on his head
with her wings so that Kamar al-Zaman awoke not.
Then Princess Budur shook him with her hands and
said:</p>

<p>“My life on thee, hearken to me; awake and
up from thy sleep and look on the narcissus and the
tender down thereon, and enjoy the sight of naked
waist and navel; and touzle me and tumble me from
this moment till break of day! Allah upon thee, O
my lord, sit up and prop thee against the pillow and
slumber not!”</p>

<p>Still Kamar al-Zaman made her no reply but<span class="pagenum" id="Page_79">79</span>
breathed hard in his sleep. Continued she:</p>

<p>“Alas! Alas! thou art insolent in thy beauty
and comeliness and grace and loving looks! But if
thou art handsome, so am I handsome; what then is
this thou dost? Have they taught thee to flout me
or hath my father, the wretched old fellow, made
thee swear not to speak to me to-night?”</p>

<p>But Kamar al-Zaman opened not his mouth
neither awoke, whereat her passion for him redoubled
and Allah inflamed her heart with love of him. She
stole one glance of eyes that cost her a thousand
sighs: her heart fluttered, and her vitals throbbed
and her hands and feet quivered; and she said to
Kamar al-Zaman:</p>

<p>“Talk to me, O my lord! Speak to me, O
my friend! Answer me, O my beloved, and tell me
thy name, for indeed thou hast ravished my wit!”</p>

<p>And during all this time he abode drowned
in sleep and answered her not a word, and Princess
Budur sighed and said:</p>

<p>“Alas! Alas! why art thou so proud and
self-satisfied?”</p>

<p>Then she shook him and turning his hand
over, saw her seal-ring on his little finger, whereat
she cried a loud cry, and followed it with a sigh of
passion and said:</p>

<p>“Alack! Alack! By Allah, thou art my
beloved and thou lovest me! Yet thou seemest to
turn thee away from me out of coquetry, for all, O
my darling, thou camest to me, whilst I was asleep
and knew not what thou didst with me, and tookest
my seal-ring; and yet I will not pull it off thy finger.”</p>

<p>So saying, she opened the bosom of his shirt
and bent over him and kissed him and put forth her<span class="pagenum" id="Page_80">80</span>
hand to him, seeking somewhat that she might take
as a token, but found nothing. Then she thrust her
hand into his breast and, because of the smoothness
of his body, it slipped down to his waist and thence
to his navel and thence to his yard, whereupon her
heart ached and her vitals quivered and lust was sore
upon her, for that the desire of women is fiercer than
the desire of men,<a id="FNanchor_56" href="#Footnote_56" class="fnanchor">56</a> and she was ashamed of her own
shamelessness.</p>

<p>Then she plucked his seal-ring from his
finger, and put it on her own instead of the ring he
had taken, and bussed his inner lips and hands, nor
did she leave any part of him unkissed; after which
she took him to her breast and embraced him and,
laying one of her hands under his neck and the other
under his arm-pit, nestled close to him and fell asleep
by his side.</p>

<p>... When Princess Budur fell asleep by the
side of Kamar al-Zaman, after doing that which she
did, quoth Maymunah to Dahnash:</p>

<p>“Sawst thou, O accursed, how proudly and
coquettishly my beloved bore himself, and how hotly
and passionately thy mistress showed herself to my
dearling? There can be no doubt that my beloved
is handsomer than thine; nevertheless I pardon
thee.”</p>

<p>... The two Ifrits went forward to Princess<span class="pagenum" id="Page_81">81</span>
Budur and upraising her flew away with her; then,
bearing her back to her own place, they laid her on
her own bed, while Maymunah abode alone with
Kamar al-Zaman, gazing upon him as he slept, till
the night was all but spent, when she went her way.
As soon as morning morrowed, the Prince awoke from
sleep and turned right and left, but found not the
maiden by him and said in his mind:</p>

<p>“What is this business? It is as if my father
would incline me to marriage with the damsel who
was with me and have now taken her away by stealth,
to the intent that my desire for wedlock may
redouble.”</p>

<p>Then he called out to the eunuch who slept
at the door, saying:</p>

<p>“Woe to thee, O damned one, arise at once!”</p>

<p>So the eunuch rose, bemused with sleep, and
brought him basin and ewer, whereupon Kamar
al-Zaman entered the water-closet and did his need;<a id="FNanchor_57" href="#Footnote_57" class="fnanchor">57</a>
then, coming out, made the Wuzu-ablution and
prayed the dawn-prayer, after which he sat telling
on his beads the ninety-and-nine names of Almighty
Allah....</p>

<p><i>Strictly speaking, the rest of the story, which
is of great length, is somewhat out of place in this
volume. The reader, however, may be interested to
know the upshot of the stratagem adopted by the genii,
so we take leave to give it, summarising where necessary.</i></p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_82">82</span></p>

<p><i>Kamar al-Zaman and the Princess Budur,
madly in love but grief-stricken by their separation,
are eventually brought together and married. Later
while on a journey, they are again separated by divers
mischances, Kamar becoming an assistant to a gardener,
while Budur, having adopted male garb to preserve
her chastity, reaches the dominions of King Armanus.
Here she is taken for a king’s son, and Armanus, who
is old, gives her his daughter Hayat al-Nufus in
marriage and makes her lord of his kingdom. An
embarrassing situation now arises, Budur being unable
to consummate the marriage or to explain her failure
to the bride. Matters come to a crisis on the third
night when Hayat speaks out. The text continues</i>:&mdash;</p>

<p>... Hayat al-Nufus caught her by the skirt
and clung to her, saying:</p>

<p>“O my lord, art thou not ashamed before my
father, after all his favour, to neglect me at such a
time as this”</p>

<p>When Queen Budur heard her words, she sat
down in the same place and said:</p>

<p>“O my beloved, what is this thou sayest?”</p>

<p>She replied:</p>

<p>“What I say is that I never saw any so proud
of himself as thou. Is every fair one so disdainful?
I say not this to incline thee to me; I say it only of
my fear for thee from King Armanus; because he
purposeth, unless thou go in unto me this very night,
and do away my maidenhead, to strip thee of the
kingship on the morrow and banish thee his kingdom;
and peradventure his excessive anger may lead him
to slay thee. But I, O my lord, have ruth on thee and
give thee fair warning; and it is thy right to reck.”</p>

<p>Now when Queen Budur heard her speak<span class="pagenum" id="Page_83">83</span>
these words, she bowed her head groundwards
awhile in sore perplexity and said in herself:</p>

<p>“If I refuse I’m lost; and if I obey I’m shamed.
But I am now Queen of all the Ebony Islands and
they are under my rule, nor shall I ever again meet
my Kamar al-Zaman save in this place; for there is
no way for him to his native land but through the
Ebony Islands. Verily, I know not what to do in
my present case, but I commit my care to Allah who
directeth all for the best, for I am no man that I should
arise and open this virgin girl.”</p>

<p>Then quoth Queen Budur to Hayat al-Nufus:</p>

<p>“O my beloved, that I have neglected thee
and abstained from thee is in my own despite.”</p>

<p>And she told her her whole story from
beginning to end and showed her person to her,
saying:</p>

<p>“I conjure you by Allah to keep my counsel,
for I have concealed my case only that Allah may
re-unite me with my beloved Kamar al-Zaman and
then come what may.”</p>

<p>... The Princess heard her with extreme
wonderment and was moved to pity and prayed Allah
to re-unite her with her beloved, saying:</p>

<p>“Fear nothing, O my sister; but have patience
till Allah bring to pass that which must come to pass....
O my sister, verily the breasts of the noble and
brave are of secrets the grave; and I will not discover
thine.”</p>

<p>Then they toyed and embraced and kissed
and slept till near the Mu’ezzin’s call to dawn-prayer,
when Hayat al-Nufus arose and took a pigeon-poult,<a id="FNanchor_58" href="#Footnote_58" class="fnanchor">58</a>
and cut its throat over her smock and besmeared
herself with its blood. Then she pulled off her
petticoat-trousers and cried aloud, whereupon her
people hastened to her and raised the usual lullilooing
and outcries of joy and gladness....</p>
<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_84">84</span></p>
<p><i>We can omit a description of the manner in
which Kamar al-Zaman is at length brought to the
Ebony Islands, where honour and dignity are heaped
upon him, in particular by Queen Budur, whom he
believes to be a man and the king of the dominion.
Growing suspicious of these favours, Kamar asks

<p>... Answered Kamar al-Zaman:</p>

<p>“O King, verily this favour, if there be no
reason for it, is indeed a wonder of wonders, more by
token that thou hast advanced me to dignities such
as befit men of age and experience, albeit I am as it
were a young child.”</p>

<p>And Queen Budur rejoined:</p>

<p>“The reason is that I love thee for thine<span class="pagenum" id="Page_85">85</span>
exceeding loveliness and thy surpassing beauty; and
if thou wilt but grant me my desire of thy body, I
will advance thee yet farther in honour and favour
and largesse; and I will make thee Wazir, for all thy
tender age, even as the folk made me Sultan over
them and I no older than thou....”</p>

<p>When Kamar al-Zaman heard these words,
he was abashed and his cheeks flushed till they
seemed aflame; and he said:</p>

<p>“I need not these favours which lead to the
commission of sin; I will live poor in wealth but
wealthy in virtue and honour.”</p>

<p>Quoth she:</p>

<p>“I am not to be duped by thy scruples, arising
from prudery and coquettish ways; and Allah bless
him who saith:&mdash;</p>

<p><i>To him I spake of coupling, but he said to me,
‘How long this noyous long persistency?’</i></p>

<p><i>But when gold piece I showëd him, he cried,
‘Who from the Almighty Sovereign e’er shall flee?’</i>”</p>

<p>Now when Kamar al-Zaman heard these
words and understood her verses and their import, he
said:</p>

<p>“O King, I have not the habit of these doings,
nor have I strength to bear these heavy burthens for
which elder age than I have proved unable; then
how will it be with my tender age?”</p>

<p>But she smiled at his speech and retorted:</p>

<p>“Indeed, it is a matter right marvellous how
error springeth from the disorder of man’s intendiment!
Since thou art a boy, why standest thou in
fear of sin or the doing of things forbidden, seeing
that thou art not yet come to the years of canonical
responsibility; and the offences of a child incur<span class="pagenum" id="Page_86">86</span>
neither punishment nor reproof? Verily, thou hast
committed thyself to a quibble for the sake of contention,
and it is thy duty to bow before a proposal
of fruition, so henceforward cease from denial and
coyness, for the commandment of Allah is a decree
foreordained: indeed, I have more reason than thou
to fear falling and by sin to be misled; and well-inspired
was he who said:&mdash;</p>

<p><i>My prickle is big and the little one said,
‘Thrust boldly in vitals with lion-like stroke!’</i></p>

<p><i>Then I, ‘’Tis a sin!’; and he, ‘No sin to me!’
So I had him at once with a counterfeit poke.”</i><a id="FNanchor_59" href="#Footnote_59" class="fnanchor">59</a></p>

<p>When Kamar al-Zaman heard these words,
the light became darkness in his sight and he said:</p>

<p>“O King, thou hast in thy household fair
women and female slaves, who have not their like in
this age: shall not these suffice thee without me?
Do thy will with them and let me go!”</p>

<p>She replied:</p>

<p>“Thou sayest sooth, but it is not with them
that one who loveth thee can heal himself of torment
and can abate his fever; for, when tastes and inclinations
are corrupted by vice, they hear and obey other
than good advice. So leave arguing and listen to what
the poet saith:&mdash;</p>

<p><i>Seest not the bazaar with its fruit in rows?
These men are for figs and for sycamore those!</i><a id="FNanchor_60" href="#Footnote_60" class="fnanchor">60</a></p>

<p>“And what another saith:&mdash;</p>

<p><i>O beauty’s Union! love for thee’s my creed;
free choice of Faith and eke my best desire</i>:</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_87">87</span></p>

<p><i>Women I have forsworn for thee; so may
deem me all men this day a shaveling friar.</i></p>

<p>“And yet another:&mdash;</p>

<p><i>A boy of twice ten is fit for a King!</i></p>

<p>“And yet another:&mdash;</p>

<p><i>The penis smooth and round was made with
anus best to match it: Had it been made for cunnus’
sake it had been formed like hatchet!</i></p>

<p>“And yet another said:&mdash;</p>

<p><i>My soul thy sacrifice! I chose thee out who
art not menstruous or oviparous</i>:</p>

<p><i>Did I with women mell, I should beget brats
till the wide wide world grew strait for us.</i></p>

<p>“And yet another:&mdash;</p>

<p><i>She saith</i> (<i>sore hurt in sense the most acute,
for she had proffered what did not besuit</i>):&mdash;</p>

<p>‘<i>Unless thou stroke as man should swive his
wife, blame not when horns thy brow shall incornute!</i></p>

<p>‘<i>Thy wand seems waxen, to a limpo grown:
and more I palm it, softer grows the brute!</i>’</p>

<p>“And yet another:&mdash;</p>

<p><i>Quoth she (for I to lie with her forbore), ‘O
folly-following fool, O fool to core</i>:</p>

<p>‘<i>If thou my coynte for Kiblah<a id="FNanchor_61" href="#Footnote_61" class="fnanchor">61</a> to thy coigne
reject, we’ll show thee what shall please thee more.</i>’<a id="FNanchor_62" href="#Footnote_62" class="fnanchor">62</a></p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_88">88</span></p>

<p>“And yet another:&mdash;</p>

<p><i>She proffered me a tender coynte: Quoth I,
‘I will not roger thee!’</i></p>

<p><i>She drew back, saying, ‘From the Faith he
turns, who’s turned by Heaven’s decree!</i><a id="FNanchor_63" href="#Footnote_63" class="fnanchor">63</a></p>

<p><i>’And front-wise futtering, in one day, is
obsolete persistency!’</i></p>

<p><i>Then swung she round and shining rump like
silvern lump she showëd me!</i></p>

<p><i>I cried: ‘Well done, O mistress mine! No
more am I in pain for thee;</i></p>

<p><i>’O thou of all that Allah oped<a id="FNanchor_64" href="#Footnote_64" class="fnanchor">64</a> showest me
fairest victory!’</i></p>

<p>“And yet another:&mdash;</p>

<p><i>Men craving pardon will uphold their hands;
women pray pardon with their legs on high:</i><a id="FNanchor_65" href="#Footnote_65" class="fnanchor">65</a></p>
<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_89">89</span></p>
<p><i>Out on it for a pious, prayerful work! The
Lord shall raise it in the depths to lie.</i>”<a id="FNanchor_66" href="#Footnote_66" class="fnanchor">66</a></p>

<p>When Kamar al-Zaman heard her quote this
poetry, and was certified that there was no escaping
compliance with what willed she, he said:</p>

<p>“O King of the age, if thou must needs have
it so, make covenant with me that thou wilt do this
thing with me but once, though it avail not to correct
thy depraved appetite; and that thou wilt never again
require this thing of me to the end of time; so perchance
shall Allah purge me of the sin.”</p>

<p>She replied:</p>

<p>“I promise thee this same, hoping that Allah
of His favour will relent toward us and blot out our
mortal offence; for the girdle of Heaven’s forgiveness
is not indeed so strait, but it may compass us around
and absolve us of the excess of our heinous sins and
bring us to the light of salvation out of the darkness
of error; and indeed excellently well saith the
poet:&mdash;</p>

<p><i>Of evil thing the folk suspect us twain; and
to this thought their hearts and souls are bent:</i></p>

<p><i>Come, dear! let’s justify and free their souls
that wrong us; one good bout and then&mdash;repent!”</i></p>

<p>Thereupon she made with him an agreement
and a covenant and swore a solemn oath by Him
who is Self-existent, that this thing should befall
betwixt them but once and never again for all time,
and that the desire of him was driving her to death
and perdition. So he rose up with her, on this condition,
and went with her to her own boudoir, that<span class="pagenum" id="Page_90">90</span>
she might quench the lowe of her lust, saying:</p>

<p>“There is no Majesty, and there is no Might
save in Allah, the Glorious, the Great! This is the
fated decree of the All-powerful, the All-wise!”</p>

<p>And he doffed his bag-trousers, shameful
and abashed, with the tears running from his eyes
from stress of affright. Thereat she smiled and
making him mount upon a couch with her, said to
him:</p>

<p>“After this night, thou shalt see naught that
will offend thee.”</p>

<p>Then she turned to him bussing and bosoming
him and bending calf over calf, and said to him:</p>

<p>“Put thy hand between my thighs to the
accustomed place; so haply it may stand up to prayer
after prostration.”</p>

<p>He wept and cried:</p>

<p>“I am not good at aught of this.”</p>

<p>But she said:</p>

<p>“By my life, an thou do as I bid thee, it shall
profit thee!”</p>

<p>So he put out his hand, with vitals afire for
confusion, and found her thighs cooler than cream
and softer than silk. The touching of them pleasured
him and he moved his hand hither and thither, till it
came to a dome abounding in good gifts and movements
and shifts, and said in himself:</p>

<p>“Perhaps this King is an hermaphrodite,<a id="FNanchor_67" href="#Footnote_67" class="fnanchor">67</a>
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_91">91</span>
neither man nor woman quite.”</p>

<p>So he said to her:</p>

<p>“O King, I cannot find that thou hast a tool
like the tools of men; what then moved thee to do
this deed?”</p>

<p>Then loudly laughed Queen Budur till she
fell on her back,<a id="FNanchor_68" href="#Footnote_68" class="fnanchor">68</a> and said:</p>

<p>“O my dearling, how quickly thou hast forgotten
the nights we have lain together!”</p>

<p>Then she made herself known to him, and
he knew her for his wife, the Lady Budur, daughter
of King al-Ghayur, Lord of the Isles and the Seas.
So he embraced her and she embraced him, and he
kissed her and she kissed him; then they lay down
on the bed of pleasure voluptuous....</p>

<h3><i>EXCURSUS</i> to <i>THE TALE OF KAMAR
AL-ZAMAN</i>.</h3>

<p>“We are told that in the East there was once
a woman named Moarbeda who was a philosopher
and considered to be the wisest woman of her time.
When Moarbeda was once asked: ‘In what part of a
woman’s body does her mind reside?’ she replied:
‘Between her thighs.’”&mdash;Havelock Ellis: <cite>Studies in the
Psychology of Sex</cite>, Vol. 3: <cite>The Sexual Impulse in
Women</cite>.<a id="FNanchor_69" href="#Footnote_69" class="fnanchor">69</a></p>

<hr class="tb" />

<p>The amativeness of woman, as compared
with that of man, is a question, of course, entirely
beyond the scope of this note. We must be content
with examining some of the most interesting and
pertinent extracts from the works of those qualified
to speak on the subject.</p>

<p>At the outset we are confronted with the
striking fact that, while the ancients were prone to
regard woman as generally amative, even lustful,
modern thought has exactly reversed this opinion.
“It seems to have been reserved for the nineteenth
century,” says Havelock Ellis, (<i lang="la">op. cit. supra</i>), “to
state that women are apt to be congenitally incapable<span class="pagenum" id="Page_93">93</span>
of experiencing complete sexual satisfaction, and
peculiarly liable to sexual anaesthesia. This idea
appears to have been almost unknown to the
eighteenth century....”</p>

<p>Thus we have two schools of thought, one
attributing to woman an intense sexual impulse, even
greater than in man, the other holding her sexually
frigid by nature and erotic only by pretence or
accident. We may helpfully quote again from our
Havelock Ellis, who has summarised in masterly
fashion the various authorities on both sides:&mdash;</p>

<p>“In the treatise <cite>On Generation</cite>, (chap. 5),
which until recent times was commonly ascribed to
Hippocrates,” he says, “it is stated that men have
greater pleasure in coïtus than women, though the
pleasure of women lasts longer, and this opinion,
though not usually accepted, was treated with great
respect by medical authors down to the end of the 17th
century.... Gall had stated decisively that the sexual
desires of men are stronger and more imperious than
those of women. (<cite>Fonctions du Cerveau</cite>, 1825)....
Raciborski declared that three-fourths of women
merely endure the approaches of men. (<cite>De la Puberté
chez la Femme</cite>).</p>

<p>“‘When the question is carefully inquired
into and without prejudice,’ said Lawson Tait, ‘it is
found that women have their sexual appetites far less
developed than men.’ (Lawson Tait, <cite>Provincial
Medical Journal</cite>, 1891). ‘The sexual instinct is very
powerful in man and comparatively weak in women,’
he stated elsewhere. (<cite>Diseases of Women</cite>, 1889).
Hammond stated that ... ‘it is doubtful if in one-tenth
of the instances of intercourse they [women] experience
the slightest pleasurable sensation from first to<span class="pagenum" id="Page_94">94</span>
last.’ (Hammond, <cite>Sexual Impotence</cite>).</p>

<p>“Lombroso and Ferrero consider that sexual
sensibility ... is less pronounced in women....
‘Woman is naturally and organically frigid....’
(Lombroso and Ferrero, <cite>La Donna Deliquente, la
Prostituta, e la Donna Normale</cite>, 1893). Krafft-Ebing
was of opinion that women require less sexual satisfaction
than men, being less sensual.... ‘The sensuality
of men,’ Moll states, ‘is in my opinion very
much greater than that of women.’</p>

<p>“Adler, who discusses the direction at some
length, decides that the sexual needs of women are
less than those of men, though in some cases the
orgasm in quantity and quality greatly exceeds that
of men. He believes, not only that the sexual
impulse in women is absolutely less than in men,
and requires stronger stimulation to arouse it, but that
also it suffers from a latency due to inhibition, which
acts like a foreign body in the brain ... and demands
great skill in the man who is to awaken the woman
to love.”</p>

<p>Here we have one side of the question&mdash;a side
strangely at variance with ancient thought, romance
and history. The supposed frigidity of women is
characterised by Havelock Ellis as ‘an opinion of
very recent growth ... confined, on the whole, to a
few countries.’ (<cite>Studies</cite>, vol. 3, page 196). He goes
on to quote Brierre de Boismont, who wrote: ‘Turn
to history, and on every page you will be able to
recognise the predominance of erotic ideas in
women.’ It is the same to-day, he adds, and he
attributes it to the fact that men are more easily able
to gratify their sexual impulses. (<cite>Des Hallucinations</cite>,
1862).</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_95">95</span></p>

<p>“The laws of Manu,” continues Havelock
Ellis, “attribute to women concupiscence and anger,
the love of bed and of adornment. The Jews attribute
to women greater sexual desire than to men. This is
illustrated, according to Knobel (as quoted by Dillman),
by <cite>Genesis</cite>, chapter 3, verse 16.<a id="FNanchor_70" href="#Footnote_70" class="fnanchor">70</a></p>

<p>“In Greek antiquity, ... in love between men
and women the latter were nearly always regarded
as taking the more active part. In all Greek love-stories
of early date the woman falls in love with the
man, and never the reverse. Æschylus makes even a
father assume that his daughters will misbehave if
left to themselves. Euripides emphasised the importance
of women. ‘The Euripidean woman who falls
in love thinks first of all: “How can I seduce the man
I love?”’ (E.F.M. Benecke: <cite>Antimachus of Colophon
and the Position of Women in Greek Poetry</cite>, 1896).</p>

<p>“The most famous passage in Latin literature
as to the question of whether men or women obtain
greater pleasure from sexual intercourse is that in
which Ovid relates the legend of Tiresias (<cite>Metamorphoses</cite>,
3, 317-333). Tiresias, having been both a man
and a woman, decided in favour of women.... In a
passage quoted from a lost work of Galen by the
Arabian biographer, Abu-l-Faraj, that great physician
says of the Christians ‘that they practice celibacy,
that even many of their women do so.’ So that in
Galen’s opinion it was more difficult for a woman
than for a man to be continent. The same view is
widely prevalent among Arabic authors, and there is<span class="pagenum" id="Page_96">96</span>
an Arabic saying that ‘The longing of the woman for
the penis is greater than that of the man for the
vulva.’<a id="FNanchor_71" href="#Footnote_71" class="fnanchor">71</a></p>

<p>“The early Christian Fathers clearly show
that they regard women as more inclined to sexual
enjoyment than men. That was ... the opinion of
Tertullian (<cite>De Virginibus Velandis</cite>), and it is clearly
implied in some of St. Jerome’s epistles.</p>

<p>“Notwithstanding the influence of Christianity,
among the vigorous barbarian races of mediæval
Europe the existence of sexual appetite in women
was not considered to be, as it later became, a matter
to be concealed or denied. Thus in 1068 the
ecclesiastical historian, Ordericus Vitalis (himself
half Norman and half English), narrates that the
wives of the Norman knights who had accompanied
William the Conqueror to England two years earlier
sent over to their husbands to say that they were
consumed by the fierce flames of desire, and that if
their husbands failed to return very shortly they
proposed to take other husbands. It is added that
this threat brought a few husbands back to their
wanton ladies.</p>

<p>“During the mediæval period in Europe,
largely in consequence, no doubt, of the predominance
of ascetic ideals set up by men who naturally regarded
women as the symbol of sex, the doctrine of the
incontinence of woman became firmly fixed....
Humanism and the spread of the Renaissance movement
brought in a spirit more sympathetic to women....
We begin to find attempts at analysing the sexual
emotions. In the seventeenth century a book of this<span class="pagenum" id="Page_97">97</span>
kind was written by Venette. In matters of love,
Venette declared, ‘men are but children compared to
women. In these matters women have a more lively
imagination, and they usually have more leisure to
think of love. Women are much more lascivious
and amorous than men.’ In a subsequent chapter,
dealing with the question whether men or women
receive more pleasure from the sexual embrace,
Venette concludes, after admitting the great difficulty
of the question, that man’s pleasure is greater, but
that woman’s lasts longer. (N. Venette, <cite>De la Génération
de l’Homme ou Tableau de l’Amour Conjugal</cite>,
1688).”</p>

<p>These and similar quotations, all acknowledging
or laying stress on the erotic appetite of
women, might be continued indefinitely. Among
the other supporters of the opinion quoted by Havelock
Ellis are Montaigne (<cite>Essais</cite>), Schurig (<cite>Parthenologia</cite>),
Plazzonus (<cite>De Partibus Generationi Inservientibus</cite>),
Ferrand (<cite>De la Maladie d’Amour</cite>), Zacchia
(<cite>Quæstiones Medico-Legales</cite>), Sinibaldus (<cite>Geneanthropeia</cite>),
Senancour (<cite>De l’Amour</cite>), Busch, Guttceit,<a id="FNanchor_72" href="#Footnote_72" class="fnanchor">72</a>
Mantegazza (<cite>Fisiologia del Piacere</cite>), Forel (<cite>The
Sexual Question</cite>), who believed that women are more
erotic than men, and Bloch (<cite>The Sexual Life of Our
Time</cite>), who says, “The sexual sensibility of women
is certainly different from that of men, but in strength
it is at least as great.”</p>

<p>For our part, we find it hard to ignore that<span class="pagenum" id="Page_98">98</span>
overwhelming consensus of opinion among early
writers as to the erotic nature of the average woman.
Was not this feminine amativeness the theme upon
which were built the undying <i lang="fr">contes</i> and <i lang="fr">fabliaux</i> of
Boccaccio, Bandello, Masuccio, Straparola, La Fontaine,
Poggio, Ser Giovanni, Chaucer, Brantôme and
a host of others? Are we to label Casanova’s
<cite>Memoirs</cite> as worthless because his women seem, in
our modern eyes, erotic beyond all belief? Turning
to the literature of the East, where woman’s ‘thirst for
coïtion is written between her eyes,’<a id="FNanchor_73" href="#Footnote_73" class="fnanchor">73</a> are we to hold
the feminine attributes therein described as peculiar
to those peoples and times? Must we believe that all
these writers fashioned women out of their own
lascivious fancy, or that the sexual impulse in the
women of those races has totally changed?</p>

<p>Without a doubt, time and custom are
responsible for much that seems obscure and irreconcilable.
Many of our authorities are writing of
an age in which men and women spoke and acted in
a manner which to-day seems coarse and inexcusably
free. Because in the past woman more readily gave
outward expression to her inward feeling, it does not
follow now that, by reason of her greater reserve, she<span class="pagenum" id="Page_99">99</span>
lacks these emotions.</p>

<p>History has shown us psychologists and
investigators in plenty, but they were not the psychologists
of to-day, recording the results of their
investigations with meticulous care and detail. The
sexually frigid woman, we can confidently assume,
was by no means unknown to the ancients. She was,
however, unusual, abnormal; and if a sexually frigid
woman be accounted abnormal, it is not hard to see
why a normal is deemed erotic.</p>

<p>In these times, when it is the fashion to
dissect everyone and everything, we are prone to
argue from the ordinary to the extraordinary, from the
peculiar to the general; sexual frigidity in woman, at
first an anomaly, ends in being a trait; the exception
becomes, does not prove, the rule.</p>

<p>Needless to say, a great psychologist like
Havelock Ellis has a wealth of information to offer
on the subject, and we commend our readers to his
masterly handling of it. He has something to say on
every aspect of the question, from the case of the
woman who is cold almost to the point of sexlessness
to that of the erotic wife who ‘becomes frenzied with
excitement during intercourse and insensible to
everything but the pleasure of it.’ In conclusion, he
adjusts the scales with exquisite and scientific precision,
holding that ‘the distribution of the sexual
impulse between the two sexes is fairly balanced.’</p>

<p>Earlier on, however, he makes a point which
we shall do well to bear in mind. ‘ ... Sexual
impulse is by no means so weak in women as many
would lead us to think. It would appear that, whereas
in earlier ages there was generally a tendency to
credit women with an unduly large share of the<span class="pagenum" id="Page_100">100</span>
sexual impulse, there is now a tendency unduly to
minimise the sexual impulse in women.’</p>

<p>We shall have frequent occasion in subsequent
volumes of <em>Anthologica Rarissima</em> to return
to this subject, for, as the student of folk-lore,
psychology and human life will readily agree, sexual
impulse is perhaps the most powerful basic motive of
our many daily acts and tasks.<a id="FNanchor_74" href="#Footnote_74" class="fnanchor">74</a></p>

<p class="drop-cap">A peasant and his wife had a half-witted son,
who pictured himself married and sleeping
with his wife. He spoke of this matter to
his father.</p>

<p>“Marry me, little father,” he said.</p>

<p>Said the little father:</p>

<p>“Wait, my son. You are still too young to
marry. Thy yard hath not yet reached to thy backside.
When it doth reach there, I will marry thee.”</p>

<p>The son seized his yard with his two hands,
stretched it with all his strength, and inspected it.</p>

<p>“‘Tis true,” quoth he. “It hath not yet
reached to my backside. ‘Tis still too soon for me to
marry. My yard is yet small. It reacheth not to my
backside. I must wait a year or two.”</p>

<p>Time passed. The youth had naught to do
but lengthen his yard; and he did it so often and so
well that not only did his yard reach to his backside,
but even passed beyond it.</p>

<p>“I shall have no shame in sleeping with my
wife,” said he. “I will satisfy her myself. She will
have no need to resort to strangers.”</p>

<p>“Vain to expect sense on the part of a fool,<span class="pagenum" id="Page_102">102</span>”
argued the father to himself; and he spake his son,
saying:</p>

<p>“Since thy yard is become so great that it
passeth beyond thy backside, there is no need for
thee to marry. Live single, rest at home, and futter
thyself.”</p>

<p><i>Of a young man of Rouen, married to a fair
young girl of the age of fifteen or thereabouts; and
how the mother of the girl wished to have the marriage
annulled by the Judge of Rouen, and of the sentence
which the said Judge pronounced when he had heard
the parties&mdash;as you will hear more plainly in the
course of the said story.</i></p>


<div>
  <img class="drop-cap" src="images/i.jpg" alt="" />
</div>
<p class="drop-cap">In the good town of Rouen, not long ago, a
young man was married to a fair and tender
virgin, aged fifteen, or thereabouts. On the
day of the great feast&mdash;that is to say, the
wedding&mdash;the mother of the young girl, as is customary
in such places, instructed the bride in all the
mysteries of wedlock, and taught her how to behave
to her husband on the first night.</p>

<p>The young girl, who was looking forward to
the time when she could put these doctrines into
practice, took great pains and trouble to remember the
lesson given her by her good mother, and it seemed to
her that when the time came for her to put these
counsels into execution, that she would perform her
duties so well that her husband would praise her, and<span class="pagenum" id="Page_105">105</span>
be well pleased with her.</p>

<p>The wedding was performed with all honour
and due solemnity, and the desired night came; and
soon after the feast was ended, and the young people
had withdrawn after having taken leave of the newly
married couple, the mother, cousins, neighbours, and
other lady friends led the bride to the chamber where
she was to spend the night with her husband, where
they joyfully divested her of her raiment, and put
her to bed, as was right and proper. Then they
wished her good-night, and one said:</p>

<p>“My dear, may God give thee joy and pleasure
in thy husband, and mayst thou so live with him as
to be for the salvation of both your souls.”</p>

<p>Another said:</p>

<p>“My dear, God give thee such peace and
happiness with thy husband, that the heavens may
be filled with your works.”</p>

<p>And all, having expressed similar wishes,
left. The bride’s mother, who remained the last,
questioned her daughter if perchance she had remembered
the lesson she had been taught. And the
girl, who, as the proverb goes, did not carry her tongue
in her pocket, replied that she well remembered all
that had been told her, and&mdash;thank God&mdash;had forgotten
nothing.</p>

<p>“Well done,” said the mother. “Now I will
leave thee, recommending thee to God and praying
that He may give thee good luck. Farewell, my dear
child.”</p>

<p>“Farewell, my good and wise mother.”</p>

<p>As soon as the schoolmistress<a id="FNanchor_79" href="#Footnote_79" class="fnanchor">79</a> had finished,<span class="pagenum" id="Page_106">106</span>
the husband, who was outside the door expecting
something better, came in. The mother closed the
door, and told him that she hoped he would be gentle
with her daughter. He promised that he would, and
as soon as he had bolted the door, he&mdash;who had nothing
on but his doublet&mdash;threw it off, jumped on the bed,
drew as close as he might to his bride, and, lance in
hand, prepared to give battle.</p>

<p>But when he approached the barrier where
the skirmish was to take place, the girl laid hold of
his lance, which was as straight and stiff as a cow-keeper’s
horn, and when she felt how hard and big it
was, she was sore affrighted, and fell to crying aloud,
saying that her shield was not of a strength to receive
and bear the blows of so huge a weapon.</p>

<p>All his efforts notwithstanding, the husband
could not persuade her to joust with him, and this
bickering endured throughout the night, without his
being able to do aught, which much displeased our
bridegroom. Nevertheless, he abode patient, hoping
to make up for the time lost on the following night;
but ‘twas the same as on the first night, even so on
the third, and even so up to the fifteenth, matters
remaining just as I have related.</p>

<p>And when fifteen days had passed since the
young couple were wed, they still not having come
together, the mother came to visit her pupil, and after
a thousand questions, spoke to the girl of her husband,
demanding what sort of a man he was and whether
he did his duty well. And the girl answered that he
was very well as a man, and was a quiet and a peaceable.</p>

<p>“But,” said the mother, “doth he do what he
ought to do?”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_107">107</span></p>

<p>“Yea,” quoth the girl, “but....”</p>

<p>“But <em>what</em>?” said the mother. “Thou art
keeping something back, I am assured. Tell me
forthwith and conceal naught; for I must know now.
Is he a man capable of performing his marital duties
in the way I taught thee?”</p>

<p>The poor girl, being thus pressed, was obliged
to own that he had not yet done the business, but
she did not say that she was the cause of the delay,
and that she had always refused the combat.</p>

<p>When her mother heard this sad news, God
knows what a disturbance she made, swearing by all
her gods that she would soon find a remedy for that,
for she was well acquainted with the Judge of Rouen,
who was her friend, and would favour her cause.</p>

<p>“The marriage must be annulled,” said she,
“and I have no doubt but that I shall find a way, and
thou mayst be sure, my child, that before two days
are past thou wilt be divorced and married to another
man, who will not let thee rest in peace all that time.
Dost leave the business to me.”</p>

<p>The good woman, half beside herself, went
and related her wrong to her husband, the father of
the girl, and told him that they had lost their daughter,
and adducing many reasons why the marriage should
be annulled.</p>

<p>She pleaded her cause so well that her husband
took her side, and was content that the bridegroom
(who knew no reason why a complaint should
be lodged against him) should be cited before the
Judge. But, at any rate, he was personally summoned
to appear before the Judge, at his wife’s demand, to
show cause why he should not leave her, and permit
her to marry again, or explain the reason why, in so<span class="pagenum" id="Page_108">108</span>
many days that he had lived with her, he had not
demonstrated that he was a man, and performed the
duties that a husband should.</p>

<p>When the day came, the parties presented
themselves at the proper time and place, and they
were called upon to state their case. The mother of
the bride began to plead her daughter’s cause, and
God knoweth the laws concerning marriage which
she quoted, none of which, she maintained, had her
son-in-law fulfilled; therefore she demanded that he
should be divorced from her daughter forthwith
without more ado.</p>

<p>The young man was much astonished to find
himself thus attacked, but lost no time in replying to
the allegations of his adversary, quietly stating his
case, and relating in what wise his wife had always
refused him leave to perform his marital duties.</p>

<p>The mother, when she heard this reply, was
more wroth than ever, and could scarce bring herself
to believe it; and she asked her daughter if that was
true which her husband had said.</p>

<p>“Yea, truly, mother,” replied the girl.</p>

<p>“Oh, wretched child,” said her mother.
“Wherefore didst thou refuse? Did I not teach thee
thy lesson many times?”</p>

<p>The poor girl might not answer, so shamed
was she.</p>

<p>“At any rate,” said the mother, “I must know
the reason why thou hast refused. Tell it me forthwith,
lest I grow exceeding wroth.”</p>

<p>The girl was forced to confess that she had
found the lance of the champion so vast, that she had
not dared to present her shield lest he killed her; and
so she still felt, nor was she reassured on that point,<span class="pagenum" id="Page_109">109</span>
albeit her mother had bade her be without fear.
Whereat the mother addressed the Judge, saying:</p>

<p>“Monseigneur, thou hast heard the confession
of my daughter, and the defence of my son-in-law.
I beg of thee give judgement forthwith.”</p>

<p>The Judge gave orders for a bed to be prepared
in his house, the couple to lie on it together;
and he commanded the bride boldly to lay hold of
the tilting staff,<a id="FNanchor_80" href="#Footnote_80" class="fnanchor">80</a> and put it where it was ordered to
go. When this judgement was delivered, the mother
said:</p>

<p>“I thank thee, my lord; thou hast judged well.
Come, my child, do what thou shouldst, and take
heed to obey the Judge, and put the lance where it
should be put.”</p>

<p>“I am satisfied,” answered the daughter, “to
put it where it ought to go, but it may rot there ere I<span class="pagenum" id="Page_110">110</span>
take it out again.”</p>

<p>So they quitted the court, and went and
carried out the sentence themselves, without the aid
of any sergeants. By this means the young man
enjoyed his joust, and was sooner weary of it than she
who would not begin.<a id="FNanchor_81" href="#Footnote_81" class="fnanchor">81</a></p>

THE HAYCOCKS.<a id="FNanchor_82" href="#Footnote_82" class="fnanchor">82</a></h2>


<div>
  <img class="drop-cap" src="images/a.jpg" alt="" />
</div>
<p class="drop-cap">A peasant died and left three sons. On their
return home from the interment of their
father, the three young men took counsel
together. The dead man had not been
wealthy, and he bequeathed to his sons only his
house and a small piece of land.</p>

<p>After much discussion, it was decided that
the eldest should leave the house and land to his
brethren, and go forth into the world to seek his
fortune. If he succeeded, he would return forthwith
to his brethren that they might share his good fortune,
but if he did not return within a year and a day, the
second brother should set out in search of him. This
agreed, the eldest embraced his brethren and set
forth.</p>

<p>Sallying from the village, he discovered two
roads. In perplexity, he tossed a coin in the air, and
as it fell, so he made his choice. He journeyed long
without encountering aught but inns and farms,
where he spent the night, renewing his quest on the
morrow. At length, after travelling fifteen days, he
came to a magnificent castle.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_112">112</span></p>

<p>“‘Tis here perchance I shall find fortune,”
quoth he. “I will enter the castle and seek service
within.”</p>

<p>But all the offices were filled. Going forth,
he encountered the owner of the castle, who was king
of the countryside, and at his request the youth related
his purpose in coming to this domain.</p>

<p>Quoth the king:</p>

<p>“Employment I have none to offer thee in
my palace; but I have a better proposal to make. I
have a daughter of the like not seen elsewhere on
earth. She pisseth over the most lofty houses. All
the physicians I have summoned cannot cure her,
and it is a sad pity, for she is of surpassing beauty.
If thou canst prevent her from pissing over the
haycocks which thou shalt erect, thy fortune is made.
I will give her to thee in marriage. If thou failest,
thou shalt go join in their prison those imbeciles of
physicians and charlatans who have already sought
to succeed in this my proposal. Thou dost understand?
See then if thou believest thyself capable of
this achievement.”</p>

<p>The youth, having taken counsel with himself
for several moments, accepted the king’s proposal.
This latter, leading him within the palace, set him to
dine with his wife and daughter. The Princess was
a marvel of beauty, and the peasant could not satiate
his eyes of her perfections. He was apportioned a
chamber in the castle, what time he awaited the day
of his trial.</p>

<p>On the morrow the young adventurer chose
a vast field, and thither caused to be borne five or six
hundred loads of hay. Next he took a hundred
peasants and set them to erect an enormous haycock.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_113">113</span></p>

<p>“If the Princess doth succeed in pissing o’er
this heap of hay,” he thought, “I am mad.” And he
went to tell the king the haycock was ready.</p>

<p>On the morrow came the Princess; and she
fell to laughing when she saw the haycock. She
raised her robe and pissed high o’er the heap of hay.
The youth was thunderstruck. On the order of the
king, they seized the youth and cast him into a
dungeon with the physicians who had essayed the
venture before him.</p>

<p>A year and a day after the departure of his
eldest brother, the second peasant set forth in his turn,
taking the road followed by his brother one year
before. Journeying fifteen days, he, too, came upon
the castle, and, entering therein, demanded the work
of a servant. Him also the king saw, putting the
proposal he had made to his elder brother. Which
proposal the youth accepted.</p>

<p>Well received by the family of the Princess,
he pictured himself already the son-in-law of the
king, and built project upon project for the future.
He chose a vast plain, and thither caused to be borne
six thousand loads of hay. Next he took one thousand
labourers and set them to erect the haycock.</p>

<p>On the morrow the Princess approached the
haycock, gave vent to a great shriek of laughter,
raised her robe, and&mdash;pissed high o’er the haycock.</p>

<p>And the second brother went to join his elder
in the dungeon of the king’s palace.</p>

<p>The youngest peasant was sore pained in that
his brethren returned not.</p>

<p>“Assuredly they have suffered some mischance
in their travels,” quoth he to himself. “‘Twere
ill of me did I not set forth in search of them, and<span class="pagenum" id="Page_114">114</span>
render them aid in their misfortune.”</p>

<p>He, in his turn, quitted the village. Chance
took him by the same road as that taken by his
brethren, and he came to the palace of the king who
held them prisoner. He entered the palace, saw the
king, and accepted the proposal made to him. At
table he found the Princess adorable, and the Princess
found him charming. This he perceived, and resolved
never to quit her side. All night he dreamed of the
Princess, nor did he wake till the sun was up. Then
he fell to leisurely reflection.</p>

<p>“All the same,” said he to himself, “if I
succeed in taking the maidenhead of the Princess
before the trial, perchance she will not piss so high.
I am convinced that all dependeth on her virginity.
I will attempt this method.”</p>

<p>When day came, he arose and went to walk
in the castle park. The Princess had not slept the
whole night long, ever seeing the countenance of the
young man. At daybreak she arose and went to
walk in the park, where she encountered the young
peasant.</p>

<p>And this last did not let slip the occasion; he
approached the young girl and avowed that he died
of love for her. The Princess was easy of persuasion,
and one hour afterward she had lost her maidenhead.
Then she re-entered the palace, the youth walking
till the hour of the morning meal, when he, too,
entered the palace as if naught had happened.</p>

<p>At noontide he caused to be borne into a
corner of the park a single load of hay; then told the
king that he was ready for the trial.</p>

<p>And when the king, accompanied by his
daughter, approached the tiny haycock which had<span class="pagenum" id="Page_115">115</span>
been erected by the young man, he cried out that the
trial was not serious, and he counselled the peasant
to construct a much loftier haycock. But the peasant
affirmed that the heap of hay was sufficient, whereat
the king ordered his daughter to piss.</p>

<p>Who was the most astonished? Truly the
king and the Princess, when the latter only succeeded
in watering her stockings, for the charming channel,
wherein the young man had laboured with the girl,
from being narrow, had grown great.</p>

<p>Judge then if the peasant was satisfied. The
Princess, though she did not let the youth perceive it,
was likewise satisfied. And the king gave his
daughter to the young man, their nuptials were
celebrated, the young peasants became princes, and
all lived happily ever afterward.</p>

<h2 title="THE COMB.">THE COMB.<a id="FNanchor_83" href="#Footnote_83" class="fnanchor">83</a></h2>


<p>An old man bought a sheep’s cloak for his
wife, and he futtered her the whole night long at the
foot of the fence. In the morning the weather was
damp, and the old woman, with back bent, went
weeping; but the old man followed and mounted her.
Said the woman to her husband:</p>

<p>“Tear me not in this fashion, Gabriel!”</p>

<p>But the man was hard of hearing, knew not
what she said, thrust his yard into her, and futtered
her dog-fashion.... The eye is ne’er too weary to see,
nor the backside to fizzle, nor the nose to take snuff,
nor the coynte to lose the chance of a goodly futter.... But
this by way of a prelude ... a foreword.</p>

<hr class="tb" />

  <img class="drop-cap" src="images/o.jpg" alt="" />
</div>
<p class="drop-cap">Once there lived a pope,<a id="FNanchor_84" href="#Footnote_84" class="fnanchor">84</a> who possessed a
daughter, a virgin and an artless. And when
summer came the pope was wont to hire
workmen to mow the hay; and he hired
them in this wise:</p>

<p>If his daughter pissed o’er the haycock which
the workman had mown, the man went wageless.<span class="pagenum" id="Page_117">117</span>
Workmen a-plenty hired themselves to the pope, but,
one and all, they laboured wageless; the daughter,
whatsoe’er the height of the haycock, pissed o’er it.</p>

<p>Yet another workman and a bold did accept
the conditions; if the pope’s daughter pissed o’er the
haycock which he had mown, no claim for his work
would he make. Then mowed the workman his hay;
when he had mown it and set it in a heap, he lay
down beside the haycock, drew forth his yard from
his drawers, and fell to toying with it. The pope’s
daughter drew nigh to the workman to scrutinise the
haycock, cast a glance at him, and said:</p>

<p>“What dost thou, little peasant?”</p>

<p>“I rub my comb.”</p>

<p>“What dost comb with this comb of thine?”</p>

<p>“Come&mdash;I will comb thee. Lie down on the
hay.”</p>

<p>The pope’s daughter lay down on the hay,
the workman fell to combing her, and he winnowed
her as was proper. Anon the young girl rose up and
said:</p>

<p>“What a delicious comb!”</p>

<p>Afterwards she sought to piss o’er the haycock;
of no avail; she did piss upon herself, as it
might run from a sieve. Seeking out her father, she
spake him, saying:</p>

<p>“The haycock is too high; I may not piss o’er
it.”</p>

<p>“Ah! my daughter! here in sooth is a goodly
workman. I will hire him for a year.”</p>

<p>And when the workman came to receive his
wage, the pope said:</p>

<p>“Friend, hire thyself to me for a year.”</p>

<p>“I am willing,” quoth the workman; and he<span class="pagenum" id="Page_118">118</span>
hired himself to the pope. Most contented, too, was
the pope’s daughter, and when night came she sought
the workman, saying:</p>

<p>“Comb me.”</p>

<p>“Nay, I will not comb thee for nought. Give
me one hundred roubles. Buy the comb.”</p>

<p>The pope’s daughter gave him one hundred
roubles, and nightly he combed her.</p>

<p>Came a time when the workman fell out with
the pope, saying:</p>

<p>“Render me my wage, little father.”</p>

<p>His wage rendered, the workman went his
way. Now the pope’s daughter was not present
when these things were done, but when she returned
to the house she inquired:</p>

<p>“Where is the workman?”</p>

<p>“He demanded his wage and is gone forthwith
to the village,” quoth the pope.</p>

<p>“Ah! little father! what hast thou done? He
hath carried off my comb!” cried the pope’s
daughter.</p>

<p>She hastened in pursuit, and came upon him
by a little stream; the workman had tucked up his
drawers and was fording the stream.</p>

<p>“Give me my comb!” cried the pope’s
daughter.</p>

<p>The workman took a stone and cast it into the
water.</p>

<p>“Pick it up,” said he; and, passing to the
other side of the stream, went his way.</p>

<p>The pope’s daughter tucked up her petticoat,
entered the water, and sought the comb. She rummaged
at the bottom of the stream. No comb.</p>

<p>Chanced to pass a lord, who cried to her:</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_119">119</span></p>

<p>“What seekest, little dove?”</p>

<p>“My comb! I have purchased it from a
workman for one hundred roubles; departing, he
carried it off with him. Him I pursued, and he cast
the comb in the water.”</p>

<p>The lord descended from his carriage, removed
his breeches, and entered the water in search
of the comb. They searched; together they searched.
On a sudden the pope’s daughter perceived that a
yard hung ‘twixt the lord’s legs. She seized it with
both hands, gripped it fast, and cried:</p>

<p>“Shame on thee, lord! ‘Tis my comb! Give
it me!”</p>

<p>“What dost thou, shameless one? Leave
hold of me!” said the lord.</p>

<p>“Nay, ‘tis thou who art shameless! Thou
wouldst take what pertains to another. Give me my
comb!”</p>

<p>And she dragged him by his yard to her
father.</p>

<p>The pope gazed through the window. Behold,
his daughter dragged a lord by his yard and
never ceased from crying: “Give me my comb,
wretched fellow!” what time the lord made plaintive
sound, saying: “Little father, deliver me from a death
not deserved! All my life I will not forget thee!”</p>

<p>From his drawers the pope drew forth his
yard, displayed it to his daughter through the window,
and cried:</p>

<p>“My daughter! my daughter! Here is thy
comb!”</p>

<p>“Truly ‘tis mine!” cried the daughter.
“Behold its red end! And I thought the lord had
taken it!”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_120">120</span></p>

<p>And she released this unfortunate and sped
into the house. The lord drew on his hose and took
to his heels.</p>

<p>The girl came running into the house.</p>

<p>“Where is my comb, little father?”</p>

<p>“Ah! what a daughter!” grumbled the pope.
“See, little mother. I believe she hath lost her
maidenhead.”</p>

<p>“Examine her thyself, little father,” said the
popess. “That will be better.”</p>

<p>The pope lowered his drawers and gave the
comb to his daughter. When they were in action,
the pope gasped and cried:</p>

<p>“No, no&mdash;the girl hath not lost her honour....”</p>

<p>Quoth the popess:</p>

<p>“Little father, push her honour yet further
back.”</p>

<p>“Fear not, little mother. She will not let it
fall. I have pushed it far.”</p>

<p>Thus went the pope’s daughter to the comb.
Henceforward the pope combed them both, regaling
them with his little ‘doll,’<a id="FNanchor_85" href="#Footnote_85" class="fnanchor">85</a> passing his life in futtering
both daughter and mother.</p>

<h3><i>EXCURSUS</i> to <i>THE PRINCESS WHO PISSETH
OVER THE HAYCOCKS</i> and <i>THE COMB</i>.</h3>

<p>The main theme of these two stories&mdash;&mdash; the
ability of a virgin girl to urinate to a great height&mdash;&mdash; is
founded on physiological fact, although, of course,
grossly distorted and exaggerated. “In children,” says
Havelock Ellis, (<cite>Studies in the Psychology of Sex</cite>,
vol. 5: <cite>Erotic Symbolism</cite>), “the vulva appears to look
directly forward and the clitoris and urinary meatus
easily appear, while in adult women, and especially
after attempts at coïtus have been made, the vulva
appears directed more below and behind, and the
clitoris and meatus more covered by the labia majora;
so that the child urinates forward, while the adult
woman is usually able to urinate almost directly
downwards in the erect position, though in some
cases (as may occasionally be observed in the street)
she can only do so when bending slightly forwards.</p>

<p>“This difference in the direction of the stream
formerly furnished one of the methods of diagnosing
virginity, an uncertain one, since the difference is
largely due to age and individual variation. The
main factor in the position and aspect of the vulva is
pelvic inclination....”</p>

<p>Havelock Ellis, later on in the same volume
of his <cite>Studies</cite>, again refers to the subject:</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_122">122</span></p>

<p>“A sign to which the old authors often attached
much importance was furnished by the urinary
stream. In the <cite>De Secretis Mulierum</cite>, wrongly attributed
to Albertus Magnus,<a id="FNanchor_86" href="#Footnote_86" class="fnanchor">86</a> it is laid down that ‘the
virgin urinates higher than the woman.’ Riolan, in
his <cite>Anthropographia</cite>, discussing the ability of virgins
to ejaculate urine to a height, states that Scaliger had
observed women who were virgins emit urine in a
high jet against a wall, but that married women could
seldom do this. Bonaciolus also stated that the urine
of virgins is emitted in a small stream to a distance
with an acute hissing sound. (<cite>Parthenologia</cite>, p. 281.)<a id="FNanchor_87" href="#Footnote_87" class="fnanchor">87</a>
... There is no doubt a tendency for the various
stresses of sexual life to produce an influence in this
direction, though they act far too slowly and uncertainly
to be a reliable index to the presence or the
absence of virginity.</p>

<p>“Another common ancient test of virginity
by urination rests on a psychic basis, and appears in
a variety of forms which are really all reducible to<span class="pagenum" id="Page_123">123</span>
the same principle. Thus we are told in <cite>De Secretis
Mulierum</cite> that to ascertain if a girl has been seduced
she should be given to eat of powdered crocus flowers,
and if she has been seduced she immediately urinates.
We are here concerned with auto-suggestion, and it
may well be believed that with nervous and credulous
girls this test often revealed the truth....</p>

<p>“ ... The ancient custom, known in classic
times, of measuring the neck the day after marriage
was frequently practised to ascertain if a girl was or
was not a virgin. There were various ways of doing
this. One was to measure with a thread the circumference
of the bride’s neck before she went to bed on
the bridal night. If in the morning the same thread
would not go around her neck it was a sure sign that
she had lost her virginity during the night; if it would,
she was still a virgin or had been deflowered at an
earlier period. Catullus alluded to this custom,<a id="FNanchor_88" href="#Footnote_88" class="fnanchor">88</a> which
still exists, or existed until lately,<a id="FNanchor_89" href="#Footnote_89" class="fnanchor">89</a> in the south of
France. It is perfectly sound, for it rests on the
intimate response by congestion of the thyroid gland
to sexual excitement. (<cite>Parthenologia</cite>, p. 283.)”</p>

<p class="center"><i>Tullia.</i></p>

<div>
  <img class="drop-cap" src="images/s.jpg" alt="" />
</div>
<p class="drop-cap">Sweet it is to me, dearest cousin, that thy
marriage with Caviceo is finally concluded:
for, the night which will make thee a wife in
his embraces will, I assure thee, afford thee
by far the greatest of all pleasures; provided Venus
befriend thee, as this thy heavenly shape deserveth.</p>

<p class="center"><i>Ottavia.</i></p>

<p>My mother told me this morning that I am
to be wedded to-morrow to Caviceo. And I see that
the requisites for the pomp of this event are being
prepared at home with great care: the bed, bed-room,
and so forth. But, of course, these things cause less
joy than fear in my soul; for, whatever in fine may
be that pleasure of which thou, my dearest cousin,
speakest, I neither know nor even imagine.</p>

<p class="center"><i>Tullia.</i></p>

<p>It should seem nowise strange that thou at
this age and so soft (for thou hast barely attained thy<span class="pagenum" id="Page_125">125</span>
fifteenth year), dost not know what I, though older
when I married, wholly ignored; that delight which
Pomponia used to promise and so loudly extol, having
been tasting it herself since three years.</p>

<p class="center"><i>Ottavia.</i></p>

<p>But what greatly surpriseth me is that thou
shouldst wholly ignore it. Allow me to speak more
openly now that I am on the eve of complete freedom.
For if the practice were lacking, which thou certainly
hadst not, yet thy great learning must have disclosed
these secrets to thee. I often hear thee extolled to
the clouds in the most flattering terms, because thou
art so skilled in Latin and Greek literature as in nearly
all the liberal arts that there seemeth to be naught
which thou dost not know.</p>

<p class="center"><i>Tullia.</i></p>

<p>My father had so much to do in this, that,
with the same zeal as most other girls are seeking
after the reputation of being handsome and elegant,
I was entirely bent on acquiring the honour of being
a learned maid. And they that prefer to flatter than
speak the truth, say: she hath not quite lost her time.</p>

<p class="center"><i>Ottavia.</i></p>

<p>They who will not flatter say also: scarcely
have esteem of virtue, good morals remained with
those of our sex who were considered learned, even
when they obtained this honour.</p>

<p class="center"><i>Tullia.</i></p>

<p>Would they deny I am chaste, while owning
I am learned?</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_126">126</span></p>

<p class="center"><i>Ottavia.</i></p>

<p>Ay, they would; but thou hast won the
admiration of all while taking care that thy learning
did not interfere with thy good and chaste morals; it
hath produced an extraordinary prodigy. But how
could it be possible that the Muses, who are styled
virgins, should be deemed hostile to the honour of
virgins? Why are they said to corrupt our minds, they
who are as the ardour of our souls, stimulating us all,
men and women alike, to grand and praiseworthy
actions? Undoubtedly because men, from a certain
haughty and silly malignity, envy us these resources
of which they themselves are proud, by making us the
victims of their jealousy. Men shun every poison and
venom just as we do, whom they call the weaker sex,
because the same pest which may take our lives away,
may take theirs away too. If learning be a venom and a
pest for us, as they assert, how is it that so dangerous
a thing, in order to be useful to men, (for they do not
deny but that it is useful to them), should change its
nature all on a sudden? If learning is, of its very
essence, a certain source of every evil and crime for
us, how shall they drink out of the same source the
nectarean waters of immortal glory: whilst we unhappy
and wretched women shall drink a sort of
sulphureous Stygian water which will excite us to
those debaucheries, to which they drive us by their
sway or lead us by their example? For, I remember
that thou spokest thus on this subject a few days ago
in thy conversation with Caviceo. It is exceedingly
nice of thee to have conserved until now that pure
reputation of an honest woman, with that beauty
which inflameth even the coldest, with that learning
which doth captivate those insensible of beauty.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_127">127</span></p>

<p class="center"><i>Tullia.</i></p>

<p>Thou who speakest thus, thou who knowest
that love inflameth men’s hearts, art not so simple as
I thought.</p>

<p class="center"><i>Ottavia.</i></p>

<p>Am I totally ignorant of what Caviceo’s eyes,
brow, in a word, his whole countenance so often told
me, even though he were silent? I was indeed truly
surprised at the unwonted fire of his kisses, when he
made free with me eight days ago; I know but too
well what that ardour and fire meant.</p>

<p class="center"><i>Tullia.</i></p>

<p>Thy mother was absent? thou wast alone?
thou wast not at all afraid of him?</p>

<p class="center"><i>Ottavia.</i></p>

<p>My mother was gone out; but what was to
be feared from him? Of course I feared naught.</p>

<p class="center"><i>Tullia.</i></p>

<p>All he asked was kisses?</p>

<p class="center"><i>Ottavia.</i></p>

<p>On the contrary, the fool took them against my
will, brandishing his glowing tongue between my
lips.</p>

<p class="center"><i>Tullia.</i></p>

<p>What sensation came over thee, then?</p>

<p class="center"><i>Ottavia.</i></p>

<p>I shall acknowledge it: some heat or other<span class="pagenum" id="Page_128">128</span>
hitherto unfelt passed through my veins: my whole
frame was inflamed. He thought that a maiden blush
bepainted my cheek; for a little while he forebore his
folly and busy hand.... I shall ever hate those
roguish hands, from the very fact that they with their
fire impregnated me, tortured and wearied!</p>

<p class="center"><i>Tullia.</i></p>

<p>A nice affair!</p>

<p class="center"><i>Ottavia.</i></p>

<p>Why? having stuck his hand in my breast,
he seized one of my paps, then the other; and while
he was handling each of them rather hard, lo! he
tossed me over on my back in spite of me.</p>

<p class="center"><i>Tullia.</i></p>

<p>Thou art blushing; the deed was accomplished.</p>

<p class="center"><i>Ottavia.</i></p>

<p>His left hand was laid on my bosom (I am
stating how the thing was done), he easily overcame
all my efforts; he next slipped his right hand under
my petticoat. I blush, I blush to tell it.</p>

<p class="center"><i>Tullia.</i></p>

<p>Lay aside that ridiculous modesty; fancy thou
art relating to thyself what thou art telling me.</p>

<p class="center"><i>Ottavia.</i></p>

<p>Having speedily lifted my petticoat above
my knees, he handled my thighs. Oh! hadst thou
beheld his sparkling eyes!</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_129">129</span></p>

<p class="center"><i>Tullia.</i></p>

<p>So thou wast happy then!</p>

<p class="center"><i>Ottavia.</i></p>

<p>Having carried his hand higher, he invaded
that place which, they say, distinguisheth us from the
other sex; ay, it is now a year ago, and ever since a
lot of blood doth run from me every month during
several days.</p>

<p class="center"><i>Tullia.</i></p>

<p>Bravo, Caviceo! ah! ah! ah!</p>

<p class="center"><i>Ottavia.</i></p>

<p>Oh, the rascal! “This part,” he saith, “will soon
rejoice me exceedingly. Do consent, my Ottavia.”
A little more and I had fainted at these words.</p>

<p class="center"><i>Tullia.</i></p>

<p>What did he then do?</p>

<p class="center"><i>Ottavia.</i></p>

<p>That part of me, thou wouldst scarcely
believe, hath a very small slit....</p>

<p class="center"><i>Tullia.</i></p>

<p>But inflamed, but glowing.</p>

<p class="center"><i>Ottavia.</i></p>

<p>He thrust his finger into it, and, as the place
could barely contain it, I felt a sharp pain throughout
all my senses. But he: “I have a virgin,” said he, and
no sooner said than forcibly opening my thighs which
I kept as tight as ever I could, he threw himself upon
me.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_130">130</span></p>

<p class="center"><i>Tullia.</i></p>

<p>Thou art silent? he put naught but his
finger in?</p>

<p class="center"><i>Ottavia.</i></p>

<p>I felt ... but what effrontery is mine to speak
so much about it!</p>

<p class="center"><i>Tullia.</i></p>

<p>And I too, whom thou makest so much of,
have undergone it, as thou. Naught is more daring
than a bridegroom, whom every delay doth exasperate
exceedingly, until he gathereth that flower of his bride.</p>

<p class="center"><i>Ottavia.</i></p>

<p>I soon felt some hard and warm mass between
my thighs. He forced me to open; with a robust
effort he directed that thing against my body and that
slit. But I, having mustered up strength, threw myself
to the other side, and slipping my left hand
between us both, I laid it on that place where the fray
was so furiously raging.</p>

<p class="center"><i>Tullia.</i></p>

<p>Thou couldst with one hand ward off so
powerful a catapult?</p>

<p class="center"><i>Ottavia.</i></p>

<p>Yea. “O naughty man,” would I say, “why
dost thou annoy me thus? Let me go, if thou lovest
me: by what crime have I deserved this torture?”
And tears flowed from my eyes: but such was the
state of my mind, that I did not even dare open my
mouth or utter a cry to call for help.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_131">131</span></p>

<p class="center"><i>Tullia.</i></p>

<p>Withal Caviceo did not even pierce thee
with his lance[91]? it did not enter into thy trench<a id="FNanchor_91" href="#Footnote_91" class="fnanchor">91</a>?</p>

<p class="center"><i>Ottavia.</i></p>

<p>I seized it and held it aside, but unlucky
event! I felt myself completely drenched with a
regular shower like fire, and, naked as I was, wet up
to the navel. I put my hand to it again; but when
falling on that sort of slimy fluid with which the mad
fellow had flooded me, my hand recoiled from fright
and horror.</p>

<p class="center"><i>Tullia.</i></p>

<p>Therefore neither was he vanquished nor
thou victorious, since he was very near carrying off a
real victory.</p>

<p class="center"><i>Ottavia.</i></p>

<p>Caviceo was far more agreeable to me since
that day. Nor do I know the powerful desire that
doth agitate my soul. I ignore what I long for, and
cannot mention it. All I know is that Caviceo
pleaseth me far more than all mortals; I expect from
him alone the supreme pleasure which I do not
understand, as I ignore what it may be like. I desire
naught and yet desire....</p>

<h3><i>EXCURSUS</i> to <i>THE SKIRMISH</i>.</h3>

<p>Nicolas Chorier, the author of the <cite>Dialogues
of Luisa Sigea</cite> (the book is commonly called the <cite>Aloisia</cite>
or the <cite>Meursius</cite>, after the name of the supposed author
or translator) was born at Vienne, Dauphiny, in 1612;
he received a law-doctor’s degree in 1639, and practised
the profession of lawyer at the Court of Aids in
his native town.<a id="FNanchor_92" href="#Footnote_92" class="fnanchor">92</a> A man of cultivated mind, a passionate
lover of letters, a first-rate Latinist, he devoted
only a very limited part of his time to causes of the
bar.</p>

<p>While passing out of the Jesuit Academy,
and during the course of his law studies, he tried
his hand at a variety of works both in French and
Latin.... The composition of the <cite>Aloisia</cite>, or at
least the first draft, for he must often have retouched
this chief work, may be traced back to that time. “I
wrote then,” he tells us in his <cite>Memoirs</cite>, “<cite>Epistles</cite>,
<cite>Speeches</cite>, a <cite>Political Dissertation</cite> on the French
alliance with the Ottoman Empire, and two <cite>Satires</cite>,
the one Menippean, the other Sotadical.”<a id="FNanchor_93" href="#Footnote_93" class="fnanchor">93</a> ...
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_133">133</span>
It was about the year 1660 that he had, according
to all probability, the first edition of the <cite>Aloisia</cite>
secretly printed in Lyons. The work was supposed
to have been written in Spanish, in the 16th century,
by an erudite young girl, Luisa Sigea, whose father,
Jacques Sigée, a native of France, had quitted his
country to settle down at Toledo. (Luisa Sigea, who
was born at Toledo about the year 1530 and died in
1560, says the English translator in a note, knew Latin,
Greek, Hebrew, Syriac and Arabic. She was styled
the Minerva of her time.) The Spanish work was lost;
but there remained a Latin manuscript translation of
it, which Chorier, in order to secure himself, attributed
to the learned Dutchman Joannes Meursius, dead
twenty years before.... Chorier died in 1692; he
left several manuscript works behind him, some of
which have since been printed.</p>

<div>
  <img class="drop-cap" src="images/t.jpg" alt="" />
</div>
<p class="drop-cap">There lived in Romagna a gentleman of great
worth and good breeding, called Messer Lizio
da Valbona, to whom, well-nigh in his old
age, it chanced there was born of his wife,
Madame Giacomina by name, a daughter, who grew
up fair and agreeable beyond any other of the country;
and for that she was the only child that remained to
her father and mother, they loved and tended her
exceeding dear and guarded her with marvellous
diligence, looking to make some great alliance by her.</p>

<p>Now there was a young man of the Manardi
of Brettinoro, comely and lusty of his person, by name
Ricciardo, who much frequented Messer Lizio’s house
and conversed amain with him and of whom the
latter and his lady took no more account than they
would have taken of a son of theirs. Now, this Ricciardo,
looking once and again upon the young lady
and seeing her very fair and sprightly and commendable
of manners and fashions, fell desperately in love
with her, but was very careful to keep his love secret.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_135">135</span></p>

<p>The damsel presently became aware thereof
and without anywise seeking to shun the stroke,
began on like wise to love him; whereat Ricciardo
was mightily rejoiced. He had many a time a mind
to speak to her, but kept silence for misdoubtance;
however, one day taking courage and opportunity,
he said to her:</p>

<p>“I prithee, Caterina, cause me not to die of
love.”</p>

<p>To which she straightway made answer:
“Would God thou wouldst not cause <em>me</em> die!”</p>

<p>This answer added much courage and pleasure
to Ricciardo and he said to her:</p>

<p>“Never shall aught that may be agreeable to
thee miscarry for me; but it resteth with thee to find
a means of saving thy life and mine.”</p>

<p>“Ricciardo,” answered she, “thou seest how
straitly I am guarded; wherefore, for my part, I cannot
see how thou mayst avail to come at me; but, if thou
canst see aught that I may do without shame to myself,
tell it me and I will do it.”</p>

<p>Ricciardo, having bethought himself of sundry
things, answered promptly:</p>

<p>“My sweet Caterina, I can see no way, except
that thou lie or make shift to come upon the gallery
that adjoineth thy father’s garden, where an I knew
that thou wouldst be anights, I would without fail
contrive to come to thee, how high soever it may be.”</p>

<p>“If thou have the heart to come thither,”
rejoined Caterina, “methinketh I can well enough
win to be there.”</p>

<p>Ricciardo assented and they kissed each other
once only in haste and went their ways.</p>

<p>Next day, it being then near the end of May,<span class="pagenum" id="Page_136">136</span>
the girl began to complain before her mother that she
had not been able to sleep that night for the excessive
heat Quoth the lady:</p>

<p>“Of what heat dost thou speak, daughter?
Nay, it was nowise hot.”</p>

<p>“Mother mine,” answered Caterina, “you
should say ‘to my seeming’ and belike you would say
sooth; but you should consider how much hotter are
young girls than ladies in years.”</p>

<p>“Daughter mine,” rejoined the lady, “that is
true; but I cannot make it cold and hot at my pleasure,
as belike thou wouldst have me do. We must put up
with the weather, such as the seasons make it; maybe
this next night will be cooler and thou wilt sleep
better.”</p>

<p>“God grant it may be so!” cried Caterina.
“But it is not usual for the nights to go cooling, as it
groweth towards summer.”</p>

<p>“Then what wouldst thou have done?” asked
the mother; and she answered:</p>

<p>“An it please my father and you, I would
fain have a little bed made in the gallery, that is beside
his chamber and over his garden, and there sleep.
There I should hear the nightingale sing and having
a cooler place to lie in, I should fare much better than
in your chamber.”</p>

<p>Quoth the mother: “Daughter, comfort thyself;
I will tell thy father, and as he will, so will we
do.”</p>

<p>Messer Lizio, hearing all this from his wife,
said; for that he was an old man and maybe therefore
somewhat cross-grained:</p>

<p>“What nightingale is this to whose song she
would sleep? I will yet make her sleep to the chirp<span class="pagenum" id="Page_137">137</span>
of the crickets.”</p>

<p>Caterina, coming to know this, more of
despite than for the heat, not only slept not that night,
but suffered not her mother to sleep, still complaining
of the great heat. Accordingly, next morning, the
latter repaired to her husband and said to him:</p>

<p>“Sir, you have little tenderness for yonder
girl; what mattereth it to you if she lie in the gallery?
She could get no rest all night for the heat. Besides,
can you wonder at her having a mind to hear the
nightingale sing, seeing she is but a child? Young
folk are curious of things like themselves.”</p>

<p>Messer Lizio, hearing this, said:</p>

<p>“Go to, make her a bed there, such as you
think fit, and bind it about with some curtain or other,
and there let her lie and hear the nightingale sing to
her heart’s content.”</p>

<p>The girl, learning this, straightway let make
a bed in the gallery and meaning to lie there that
same night, watched till she saw Ricciardo and made
him a signal appointed between them, by which he
understood what was to be done.</p>

<p>Messer Lizio, hearing the girl gone to bed,
locked a door that led from his chamber into the
gallery, and betook himself likewise to sleep.</p>

<p>As for Ricciardo, as soon as he heard quiet on
every hand, he mounted a wall, with the aid of a
ladder, and thence, laying hold of certain toothings of
another wall, he made his way, with great toil and
danger, if he had fallen, up to the gallery, where he
was quietly received by the girl with the utmost joy.
Then, after many kisses, they went to bed together
and took delight and pleasure one of another well
nigh all that night, making the nightingale sing many<span class="pagenum" id="Page_138">138</span>
a time.</p>

<p>The nights being short and the delight great
and it being now, though they thought it not, near
day, they fell asleep without any covering, so overheated
were they what with the weather and what
with their sport, Caterina having her right arm entwined
about Ricciardo’s neck and holding him with
the left hand by that thing which you ladies think
most shame to name among men.</p>

<p>As they slept on this wise, without awaking,
the day came on and Messer Lizio arose and remembering
him that his daughter lay in the gallery, opened
the door softly, saying in himself:</p>

<p>“Let us see how the nightingale hath made
Caterina sleep this night.”</p>

<p>Then, going in, he softly lifted up the serge
wherewith the bed was curtained about, and saw his
daughter and Ricciardo lying asleep, naked and uncovered,
embraced as it hath before been set out;
whereupon, having recognised Ricciardo, he went out
again and repairing to his wife’s chamber, called to
her, saying:</p>

<p>“Quick, wife, get thee up and come see, for
that thy daughter hath been so curious of the nightingale
that she hath e’en taken it and hath it in hand.”</p>

<p>“How can that be?” quoth she; and he
answered:</p>

<p>“Thou shalt see it, an thou come quickly.”</p>

<p>Accordingly, she made haste to dress herself
and quietly followed her husband to the bed where,
the curtain being drawn, Madam Giacomina might
plainly see how her daughter had taken and held the
nightingale, which she had so longed to hear sing;
whereat the lady, holding herself sore deceived of<span class="pagenum" id="Page_139">139</span>
Ricciardo, would have cried out and railed at him;
but Messer Lizio said to her:</p>

<p>“Wife, as thou holdest my love dear, look thou
say not a word, for, verily, since she hath gotten it, it
shall be hers. Ricciardo is young and rich and gently
born; he cannot make us other than a good son-in-law.
An he would part from thee on good terms, needs
must he first marry her, so it will be found that he
hath put the nightingale in his own cage and not in
that of another.”</p>

<p>The lady was comforted to see that her husband
was not angered at the matter and considering
that her daughter had passed a good night and rested
well and had caught the nightingale, to boot, she held
her tongue. Nor had they abidden long after these
words when Ricciardo awoke and seeing that it was
broad day, gave himself over for lost and called Caterina,
saying:</p>

<p>“Alack, my soul, how shall we do, for the day
is come and hath caught me here?”</p>

<p>Whereupon Messer Lizio came forward and
lifting the curtain, answered:</p>

<p>“We shall do well.”</p>

<p>When Ricciardo saw him, himseemed the
heart was torn out of his body and sitting up in bed,
he said:</p>

<p>“My lord, I crave your pardon for God’s sake.
I acknowledge to have deserved death, as a disloyal
and wicked man; wherefore do you with me as best
pleaseth you; but, I prithee, an it may be, have mercy
on my life and let me not die.”</p>

<p>“Ricciardo,” answered Messer Lizio, “the love
that I bore thee and the faith I had in thee merited
not this return; yet, since thus it is and youth hath<span class="pagenum" id="Page_140">140</span>
carried thee away into such a fault, do thou, to save
thyself from death and me from shame, take Caterina
to thy lawful wife, so that, like as this night she hath
been thine, she may e’en be thine so long as she shall
live. On this wise thou mayst gain my pardon and
thine own safety; but, an thou choose not to do this,
commend thy soul to God.”</p>

<p>Whilst these words were saying, Caterina let
go the nightingale and covering herself, fell to weeping
sore and beseeching her father to pardon Ricciardo,
whilst on the other hand she entreated her lover to do
as Messer Lizio wished, so they might long pass such
nights in security.</p>

<p>But there needed not overmany prayers, for
that, on the one hand, shame of the fault committed
and desire to make amends for it, and on the other,
the fear of death and the wish to escape,&mdash;to say
nothing of his ardent love and longing to possess the
thing beloved,&mdash;made Ricciardo freely and without
hesitation avouch himself ready to do that which
pleased Messer Lizio; whereupon the latter borrowed
of Giacomina one of her rings and there, without
budging, Ricciardo in their presence took Caterina to
his wife. This done, Messer Lizio and his lady
departed, saying:</p>

<p>“Now rest yourselves, for belike you have
more need thereof than of rising.”</p>

<p>They being gone, the young folk clipped each
other anew and not having run more than half a
dozen courses overnight, they ran other twain ere
they arose and so made an end of the first day’s
tilting.</p>

<p>Then they arose and Ricciardo having had
more orderly conference with Lizio a few days after,<span class="pagenum" id="Page_141">141</span>
as it beseemed, he married the damsel over again, in
the presence of their friends and kinsfolk, and brought
her with great pomp to his own house. There he
held goodly and honourable nuptials and after went
long nightingale-fowling with her to his heart’s content,
in peace and solace, both by night and by day.</p>

<div>

</div>
<p class="drop-cap">Once there lived a peasant and his wife who
had a daughter, a young virgin. The girl
went forth to harrow the garden; she harrowed
and she harrowed; anon they called
her to the house to eat pancakes. She ran and left the
horse with the harrow, saying unto the beast:</p>

<p>“Wait there until I return.”</p>

<p>There was in the house of a neighbour a son,
a foolish lad. For long he had desired to futter the
maid; but by what means he could not conceive.
Observing the horse with the harrow, he slipped
through the hedge, unharnessed the horse, and led it
into his garden. Leaving the harrow in its place, he
passed the beam through the hedge, and harnessed
the horse afresh from his side.</p>

<p>The young girl returned and stood astonished.
What meant this? The harrow on one side of the
hedge, the horse on the other? She fell to beating
the horse with her whip, saying:</p>

<p>“Devil! How camest thou there? Thou didst
know how to get there. Thou wilt know how to return.
Come! Come! Out of it!”</p>

<p>The lad stood near; he looked and laughed.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_143">143</span></p>

<p>“I will aid thee an thou wilt,” said he, “but
only if thou dost permit me....”</p>

<p>The maid was cunning.</p>

<p>“Willingly,” said she.</p>

<p>And she armed herself with the head of an
old pike, which lay about the garden, its jaws open.
Picking it up, she thrust it in her sleeve and said to
the lad:</p>

<p>“I do not wish to come to thy side of the
hedge, nor do I wish thee to come to mine, lest any
see thee. Do it through the hedge. Pass me thy yard
and I will put it in.”</p>

<p>The youth drew out his yard and passed it
through the hedge. The girl took the pike’s head,
opened it, and put it ‘twixt her thighs. When the
youth rubbed, he scratched his yard so that it bled.
Taking it in his hands, he ran to the house, sat down
in a corner, and was very silent.</p>

<p>“Ah! woe is me!” thought he to himself.
“How her coynte biteth! If only my yard will heal,
for the rest of my life I will never address another
girl!”</p>

<p>Came the time for the youth to settle down;
he was affianced to the daughter of the neighbour,
and they were wedded. They dwelt together for a
day, then two, then three; they dwelt together for a
week, then a second, then a third; but the youth
feared to touch his wife.</p>

<p>Constrained one day to go to the house of the
young man’s mother-in-law, they set out on their
way. On the road the wife said to her husband:</p>

<p>“Listen, now, my dear little Danilka. Why
hast thou married since thou dost naught with me?
If thou canst do naught, why spoilest the life of<span class="pagenum" id="Page_144">144</span>
another in this useless fashion?”</p>

<p>And Danilka replied:</p>

<p>“Nay, thou wilt not trap me again. It biteth,
thy coynte. My yard hath long been ill. ‘Tis scarce
cured yet.”</p>

<p>“Thou ravest!” answered she. “At that time
I did but play with thee. Have no fear now. Make
trial of this dear little thing<a id="FNanchor_96" href="#Footnote_96" class="fnanchor">96</a> of mine. Thou wilt be
enchanted with it.”</p>

<p>And desire took the youth, and he tucked up
his robe, saying:</p>

<p>“Wait&mdash;I am about to bind thy legs, and if
thy coynte biteth, I shall be able to leap to earth and
save myself.”</p>

<p>He let go of the reins and bound the two
naked thighs of his young wife. His instrument was
now of sufficient magnitude. When he rammed the
girl, she cried with a loud voice; the horse, which was
young, took fright and began to run away; the sleigh
was thrown from side to side; the peasant fell out;
and his young wife, her thighs naked, was dragged
into the courtyard of the mother-in-law.</p>

<p>The mother-in-law gazed through the window;
she perceived the horse of her son-in-law, and<span class="pagenum" id="Page_145">145</span>
was assured that he brought her some viands for the
feast; she went to meet him and found&mdash;her daughter!</p>

<p>“Ah! little mother!” cried the latter. “Unbind
me swiftly ere any see me.”</p>

<p>The old woman unbound her and asked what
it signified.</p>

<p>“And thy husband, where is he?” she demanded.</p>

<p>“The horse threw him into the road.”</p>

<p>These two entered the house and gazed
through the window. Danilka arrived, approached
some small boys who were playing at knuckle-bones,
stopped, and looked about him. The mother-in-law
dispatched her eldest daughter to him. She drew near,
saying:</p>

<p>“Good day, Danilka Ivanitch.”</p>

<p>“Good-day.”</p>

<p>“Come into the house. The feast lacketh but
thee.”</p>

<p>“Is my wife within?”</p>

<p>“Yea.”</p>

<p>“And hath the blood ceased to flow?”</p>

<p>But the young girl spat and ran away from
him.</p>

<p>Then the mother-in-law dispatched her
daughter-in-law, who would appease him.</p>

<p>“Come, come, little Danilka. The blood hath
ceased to flow this long time.”</p>

<p>She led him within the house, and the
mother-in-law came to meet him, saying:</p>

<p>“Welcome, my dear little son-in-law.”</p>

<p>“Varvara&mdash;is she within?”</p>

<p>“Yea.”</p>

<p>“And hath the blood ceased to flow?”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_146">146</span></p>

<p>“It hath ceased this long time.”</p>

<p>Then he drew forth his yard and showed it
to his mother-in-law, saying:</p>

<p>“See, little mother, this awl<a id="FNanchor_97" href="#Footnote_97" class="fnanchor">97</a> was entirely
inside her body.”</p>

<p>“Come, come,” said the mother-in-law. “Sit
thyself down. ‘Tis time to eat.”</p>

<p>They sat down, drank, and ate.</p>

<p><i>Casanova again meets the beautiful nun M&mdash;M&mdash;, with
whom he was on intimate terms some years
previously at Venice. The nun is now in a convent at
Chamberi, where Casanova visits her and her young
boarder, a lovely girl aged twelve or thirteen, who
readily succumbs to the adventurer’s amorous advances.

</div>
<p class="drop-cap">I went to the convent, and M&mdash;M&mdash;came
down alone to the grating. She thanked me
for coming to see her, adding that I had
come to disturb her peace of mind.</p>

<p>“I am all ready, my heart, to climb the garden
wall,” I answered, “and I shall do it more dextrously
than thy wretched humpback.”</p>

<p>“Alas! ‘tis not possible, for, believe me, thou
art already spied upon.... Let us forget all, my dear
friend, that we may be spared the torment of vain
desires.”</p>

<p>“Give me thy hand.”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_148">148</span></p>

<p>“Nay. All is over. I love thee still; probably
I shall love thee always; but I long for thee to go,
and by so doing, thou wilt give me proof of thy love.”</p>

<p>“This is dreadful; thou amazest me. Thou
dost seem in perfect health; thou art grown even
more beautiful; art made for the worship of the
sweetest of gods; ‘tis beyond my powers of comprehension
how, with a temperament like thine, thou
canst live in continual abstinence.”</p>

<p>“Alas! lacking the reality we console ourselves
with make-belief.<a id="FNanchor_99" href="#Footnote_99" class="fnanchor">99</a> I will not conceal from
thee that I love my young boarder. ‘Tis an innocent
passion, and keepeth my mind calm. Her caresses
quench the flame which would otherwise kill me.”<a id="FNanchor_100" href="#Footnote_100" class="fnanchor">100</a></p>

<p>“And doth not thy conscience suffer?”</p>

<p>“I feel no distress in the matter.”</p>

<p>“But thou dost know ‘tis a sin?”</p>

<p>“I confess it.”</p>

<p>“And what sayeth the confessor?”</p>

<p>“Naught. He absolveth me, and I am happy.”</p>

<p>“And doth thy pretty boarder confess also?”</p>

<p>“Assuredly; but she telleth not the father of
a matter which she doth not believe a sin.”</p>

<p>“I wonder that the confessor hath not taught
her, for that species of instruction is a great pleasure.”</p>

<p>“Our confessor is a wise old man.”</p>

<p>“I shall leave thee, then, without a single
kiss?”</p>

<p>“Not one.”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_149">149</span></p>

<p>“May I return on the morrow? I go hence
on the following day.”</p>

<p>“Come; but I shall not descend alone,<a id="FNanchor_101" href="#Footnote_101" class="fnanchor">101</a> for
others might have suspicions. I will bring my little
one with me, to save appearances. Come after dining,
but to the other parlour.”</p>

<p>Had I not known M&mdash;M&mdash;at Aix, her religious
ideas would have astonished me; but such was
her character. She loved God, and did not believe
that the kind Father who made us with passions
would be too severe because we had not the strength
to subdue them. I returned to the inn, annoyed that
the lovely nun would have no more to do with me....</p>

<p><i>After the interval of a night, Casanova returns
to the convent, and, announcing his presence, enters
the parlour which M&mdash;M&mdash;has indicated. The text
continues</i>:&mdash;</p>

<p>... She soon descended with her pretty young
boarder, who ... had not yet completed her twelfth
year, but was very tall, strong and well-developed for
her age. Gentleness, liveliness, candour, and wit
were united in her features, and gave her an expression
of exquisite charm. She wore a well-made corset
which disclosed a white throat, to which fancy easily
added the two spheres which would soon appear there.
Her shapely head, whence hung two superb raven
tresses, and her ivory throat indicated what might be
concealed, and my vagrant imagination formed her
into a budding Venus.</p>

<p>I began by telling her that she was very
pretty, and that she would make happy the husband<span class="pagenum" id="Page_150">150</span>
for whom God had destined her. This compliment,
I felt assured, would cause her to blush. ‘Tis cruel,
but thus it is that the language of seduction ever beginneth.
A girl of her years who doth not blush at the
mention of marriage is either a fool or already expert
in profligacy. Despite this, however, the blush which
mounteth to a young girl’s cheek at the onset of a
startling idea is indeed a problem. Whence doth it
come? Perchance from pure simplicity; perchance
from shame; often from a mixture of both feelings.
Cometh, then, the combat ‘twixt vice and virtue, and
usually ‘tis virtue which hath to succumb. The desires&mdash;true
servants of vice&mdash;easily attain their ends. As
I knew the young boarder from M&mdash;M&mdash;’s description,
I could not be unaware of the source of those blushes
which did but enhance her youthful charms.</p>

<p>Pretending not to notice aught, I conversed
for a while with M&mdash;M&mdash;, then returned to the assault.
She had regained her calm.</p>

<p>“What is thine age, pretty one?” said I.</p>

<p>“I am thirteen.”</p>

<p>“Thou art wrong, my heart,” said her friend.
“Thou hast not yet completed thy twelfth year.”</p>

<p>“The time will come,” quoth I, “when thou
wilt diminish the tale of thy years instead of increasing
it.”</p>

<p>“I shall never tell a lie, sir; of that I am sure.”</p>

<p>“So thou wouldst become a nun, my fair
friend?”</p>

<p>“I have not yet that vocation; but naught
shall force me to lie, even though I should live in the
world.”</p>

<p>“Thou art wrong, for thou wilt begin to lie
from the moment thou hast a lover.”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_151">151</span></p>

<p>“Will my lover also tell lies?”</p>

<p>“Assuredly he will.”</p>

<p>“Were the matter truly so, I should entertain
a bad opinion of love; but I do not believe it, for I
love my dear friend here, and I never conceal the
truth from her.”</p>

<p>“But thou dost not love a man as thou lovest
a woman.”</p>

<p>“Indeed one doth.”</p>

<p>“Not so, for thou dost not go to bed with a
woman, but thou wilt with thy husband.”</p>

<p>“No matter&mdash;my love would be the same.”</p>

<p>“What? Thou wouldst not rather sleep with
me than with M&mdash;M&mdash;?”</p>

<p>“Nay, in sooth, for thou art a man and would
see me.”</p>

<p>“Thou dost not desire a man to see thee,
then?”</p>

<p>“Nay.”</p>

<p>“Thou knowest that thou art ugly, then?”</p>

<p>At this she turned to her friend with a highly
vexed air.</p>

<p>“Am I truly ugly?” she asked.</p>

<p>“Nay, my heart,” said M&mdash;M&mdash;, bursting with
laughter; “‘tis quite the other way. Thou art very
pretty.” With these words, she took her on her knee
and embraced her tenderly.</p>

<p>“Thy corset is too tight, mademoiselle; ‘tis not
possible to have so small a waist as thine.”</p>

<p>“Monsieur is mistaken. Thou canst put thy
hand there and see for thyself.”</p>

<p>“I do not believe it.”</p>

<p>M&mdash;M&mdash;then held her close to the grille and
bade me assure myself on the point. At the same<span class="pagenum" id="Page_152">152</span>
moment she turned up her dress.</p>

<p>“Thou wast right,” said I, “and I owe thee an
apology.” But in my heart I cursed the chemise and
the grille.</p>

<p>“‘Tis my opinion,” quoth I to M&mdash;M&mdash;, “that
here we have a little lad.”</p>

<p>Without awaiting a reply, I laboured so well
that I satisfied myself, by touch, as to her sex, and I
could see that the little one and her governess were
pleased that my mind was at rest on the subject.</p>

<p>When I had withdrawn my hand, the little
one gave a kiss to M&mdash;M&mdash;, whose smiling air reassured
her, and begged leave to absent herself for a
moment. It seems I had reduced her to a state in
which a brief space of solitude was necessary, and I
myself was in a highly excited condition.</p>

<p>When she had gone, I said to M&mdash;M&mdash;:&mdash;</p>

<p>“Dost realise that what thou hast shown me
hath made me unhappy?”</p>

<p>“And why?”</p>

<p>“Because thy boarder is charming and I am
dying to possess her.”</p>

<p>“I grieve for that, since thou canst not go
further; moreover, I know thee, my friend, and e’en
though thou couldst satisfy thy passion without
danger to her, I would not yield her to thee; thou
wouldst spoil her.”</p>

<p>“How?”</p>

<p>“Dost think that after enjoying thee she would
care to enjoy me? I should lose too heavily by comparison.”</p>

<p>“Give me thy hand.”</p>

<p>“Nay.”</p>

<p>“Stay&mdash;one moment.”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_153">153</span></p>

<p>“I do not wish to see aught.”</p>

<p>“Not even a little?”</p>

<p>“Naught at all.”</p>

<p>“Art angered with me, then?”</p>

<p>“Far from it. If thou hast been pleased, I am
glad; and if thou hast filled her with desires, she will
love me all the more.”</p>

<p>“What happiness, my angel, could we, all
three, be alone together and at liberty!”</p>

<p>“I feel it, but ‘tis impossible.”</p>

<p>“Art sure that we are sheltered from all
curious eyes?”</p>

<p>“I am certain.”</p>

<p>“The height of that wretched grille hath deprived
me of the sight of many charms.”</p>

<p>“Why didst not go to the other parlour? ‘Tis
much lower there.”</p>

<p>“Let us go there.”</p>

<p>“Not to-day. I could give no reason for the
change.”</p>

<p>“I will return to-morrow, and in the evening
I start for Lyons.”</p>

<p>The little boarder came back, and I stood up
facing her. I had a number of beautiful seals and
trinkets hanging from my watch-chain, and I had not
had time to put myself in a state of perfect decency
again. This she noticed, and my seals serving as
a pretext for her curiosity, she asked if she might look
at them.</p>

<p>“As long as you like, my jewel; look at them
and touch them as well.”</p>

<p>M&mdash;M&mdash;, foreseeing what would happen,
left the room, saying that she would return anon. I
hastened to deprive the curious-minded young<span class="pagenum" id="Page_154">154</span>
boarder of all interest in my seals by placing in her
hands a curiosity of another kind. She did not conceal
her transports nor the pleasure she felt in satisfying
her inquisitiveness about an object which was
quite new to her, and which she was able to examine
minutely for the first time in her life. But soon an
effusion of the natural moisture changed her curiosity
into surprise, and I did not interrupt her in her delighted
contemplation of it.</p>

<p>Perceiving M&mdash;M&mdash;returning slowly, I
lowered my shirt and sat down. My watch and
chains were still on the ledge of the grating, and M&mdash;M&mdash;asked
her young friend if the trinkets had
pleased her.</p>

<p>“Yea,” replied the little one, in a dreamy and
melancholy voice. She had travelled so far in less
than two hours that she had plenty to think on.</p>

<p>I passed the rest of the day in relating to M&mdash;M&mdash;the
adventures I had encountered since I quitted
her; but as I had not time to finish my tale, I promised
to return on the following day at the same
hour.</p>

<p>The young girl, who had been listening to
me all the while, although I seemed to be addressing
only her friend, said she was dying to know the end
of my adventure with the mistress of the Duke of
Matelone.<a id="FNanchor_102" href="#Footnote_102" class="fnanchor">102</a> ...</p>

<p>... On the following day, after dining, I
returned to the convent, and having sent up my name
to M&mdash;M&mdash;, I entered the room where the grating was
more convenient. Before long M&mdash;M&mdash;arrived alone,<span class="pagenum" id="Page_155">155</span>
but divining my desires, she added that her pretty
young friend would soon join us.</p>

<p>“Thou hast fired her imagination,” she said.
“She hath told me all about it, playing a thousand
wanton tricks and calling me her dear husband.
Thou hast seduced her, and I am very glad thou art
going, for I believe she might lose her reason. Thou
wilt see how she hath attired herself.”</p>

<p>“Art sure of her discretion?”</p>

<p>“Perfectly, but I beg of thee to do naught in
my presence. When I see the moment approaching,
I will leave the room.”</p>

<p>“Thou art an angel, beloved, but thou
mightest be something better an thou wouldst&mdash;&mdash;”</p>

<p>“I want naught for myself, because that may
not be.”</p>

<p>“Thou couldst&mdash;&mdash;”</p>

<p>“Nay&mdash;I will have naught to do with a pastime
which would re-kindle fires hardly yet quenched.
I have spoken. I suffer; but let us say no more
on the matter.”</p>

<p>At this moment the young adept entered
smiling, her eyes full of fire. She was attired in a
short pelisse, open in front, and an embroidered
muslin skirt which did not go beyond her knees. She
looked like a sylph.</p>

<p>We were scarcely seated ere she reminded
me of the place where my tale had stopped. I continued
my recital, and when I was relating how
Donna Lucrezia showed me Leonilda naked, M&mdash;M&mdash;went
out, and the sly little puss asked me how
I assured myself that my daughter was a virgin.</p>

<p>Taking hold of her through the wretched
grating, against which she placed her pretty body, I<span class="pagenum" id="Page_156">156</span>
showed her how I assured myself of the fact, and the
little one found such pleasure in the game that, so far
from feeling any suffering, she twice swooned away
in ecstacy, all the while pressing my hand to the
spot. Then she gave me her hand that she might
afford me the pleasure I had given her, and when
M&mdash;M&mdash;appeared during this enjoyable occupation,
she said hastily:&mdash;</p>

<p>“It doth not matter. I have told her everything.
My friend is kind, and she will not be vexed.”</p>

<p>M&mdash;M&mdash;, in sooth, affected to see naught of
all this, and the precocious young girl wiped her
hand in a kind of voluptuous delight, which showed
how well she was pleased.</p>

<p>I proceeded with my history, but when I
came to the episode of the poor girl who was <em>tied</em>,<a id="FNanchor_103" href="#Footnote_103" class="fnanchor">103</a>
describing all the trouble I had vainly taken with her,
the little boarder grew so curious that she placed herself
in the most seducing attitude so that I might be
able to show her what I did. Seeing this, M&mdash;M&mdash;made
her escape.</p>

<p>“Kneel down on the ledge,” said the little
wanton, “and let me do it.”</p>

<p>The reader can guess her intention, and she
would have succeeded in her purpose had not the
fire which consumed me distilled itself away at the
orifice.</p>

<p>The charming novice felt herself besprinkled,
but after ascertaining that naught more could be
done, she withdrew in some vexation. My fingers,<span class="pagenum" id="Page_157">157</span>
however, consoled her for the disappointment, and I
had the pleasure of seeing her look happy once more.</p>

<p>I quitted these charming creatures in the
evening, promising to visit them again in a year, but
as I walked home I could not but reflect how often
these asylums, supposed to be devoted to chastity and
prayer, do contain in themselves the hidden germs
of corruption. How many a timorous and trustful
mother is persuaded that the child of her affection
will escape the dangers of the world by taking refuge
in the cloister. But behind these bolts and bars
desires grow to a frenzied extreme; they crave in
vain to be satisfied....</p>

<h2 title="THE HUSBAND AS DOCTOR.">THE HUSBAND AS DOCTOR.<a id="FNanchor_106" href="#Footnote_106" class="fnanchor">106</a></h2>

<p><i>Of a young squire of Champagne who, when
he married, had never mounted a Christian creature&mdash;much
to his wife’s regret. And of the method her
mother found to instruct him, and how the said squire
suddenly wept at a great feast that was made shortly
after he had learned how to perform the carnal act&mdash;as
you will hear more plainly hereafter.</i></p>


<div>
  <img class="drop-cap" src="images/t.jpg" alt="" />
</div>
<p class="drop-cap">‘Tis well known that in the province of
Champagne one is sure to encounter heavy
and dull-witted persons&mdash;which hath seemed
strange to many, seeing that the district
is so near to the country of Mischief.<a id="FNanchor_107" href="#Footnote_107" class="fnanchor">107</a> Many stories
could be told of the stupidity of the Champenois, but
this present will suffice.</p>

<p>There dwelt in this province a young man,
an orphan, who at the death of his father and mother
had become rich and powerful. He was stupid,
ignorant, and disagreeable, but hard-working, and<span class="pagenum" id="Page_163">163</span>
knew well how to take care of himself and his affairs,
and for this reason many persons&mdash;even people of
condition&mdash;were willing to give him their daughter in
marriage.</p>

<p>One of these damsels, above all others,
pleased the friends and relations of our Champenois
because of her beauty, goodness, riches and so forth.
They told him ‘twas time he married.</p>

<p>“Thou art now three-and-twenty years of
age,” said they, “and there could not be a better time.
An thou wilt listen to us, we have sought out for thee
a fair and good damsel who seemeth to us well fitted
to thee. It is such an one&mdash;thou knowest her full
well.” And they told him her name.</p>

<p>The young man, who cared little whether he
was married or not, so as he did not lose money by
it, answered that he would do whatsoe’er they wished.</p>

<p>“Since ye think ‘twill be to my advantage,”
said he, “manage the business to the best of your
ability, for I would follow your advice and instructions.”</p>

<p>“Thou sayest well,” said these good folk. “We
will look and consider as carefully as though the
matter concerned us or one of our children.”</p>

<p>To cut matters short, a little while afterwards
our Champenois was married; but on the first night,
when he was sleeping with his wife, he, never having
mounted on any Christian beast, soon turned his back
to her, and a few poor kisses was aught she had of him,
but naught on her back. At which one may guess
his wife was not well pleased, albeit she concealed
her discontent.</p>

<p>This unsatisfactory State of affairs endured
some ten days, and would have endured yet longer<span class="pagenum" id="Page_164">164</span>
had not the girl’s mother put a stop to it.</p>

<p>It should be known that the young man was
unversed in the mysteries of wedlock, for during the
lifetime of his parents a tight rein had been kept upon
him, and, above all things, he had been forbidden to
play at the beast with two backs,<a id="FNanchor_108" href="#Footnote_108" class="fnanchor">108</a> lest he should take
too much delight therein, and waste all his patrimony.
Which was prudent on the part of his parents, for he
was not a young man likely to be loved for his
appearance.</p>

<p>And since he would do naught to anger his
father and mother, and was not, moreover, of an
amorous disposition, he had ever preserved his chastity,
albeit his wife had deprived him of it right gladly
had she known but how.</p>

<p>On a certain day the mother of the bride
came to her daughter, and questioned her as to her
husband’s state and condition and the countless other
things which women like to know. To all of which
questions the bride replied that her husband was a
good man, and that she did not doubt but that she
would be happy with him.</p>

<p>Which answer made the old woman joyous,
but, since she knew by her own experience that there
are more things in wedlock than eating and drinking,
she said to her daughter:</p>

<p>“Come hither, and tell me, on thy word of
honour, how he doth acquit himself at night?”</p>

<p>When the girl heard this question she was so
vexed and shamed that she might not answer, and<span class="pagenum" id="Page_165">165</span>
her eyes were filled with tears. But her mother,
understanding what meant these tears, said:</p>

<p>“Weep not, my child. Speak me boldly. I am
thy mother, and it behoveth thee to conceal naught
from me. Hath he done naught to thee as yet?”</p>

<p>The poor girl, having partly recovered, and
being reassured by her mother’s words, ceased her
tears, but could not yet make reply. Whereupon her
mother asked again:</p>

<p>“Speak me boldly and put aside thy grief.
Hath he done naught to thee yet?”</p>

<p>In a low voice, mingled with tears, the girl
replied:</p>

<p>“On my word, mother, he hath never touched
me yet, but, save for that, there is no man more kind
or affectionate.”</p>

<p>“Tell me,” quoth the mother, “knowest thou
if he be properly furnished with all his members?
Speak boldly if thou dost know.”</p>

<p>“By St. John! He is sound in that respect,”
replied the bride. “I have often, by chance, felt his
luggage<a id="FNanchor_109" href="#Footnote_109" class="fnanchor">109</a> as I turned to and fro on our bed when I
could not sleep.”</p>

<p>“‘Tis enough,” said the mother. “Leave the
rest to me. This is what thou must do. In the
morning thou must feign grave illness&mdash;e’en as though
thy soul were about to depart thy body. Thy husband
will, I expect full well, seek me out and bid me
come to thee, and I will play my part so that thy<span class="pagenum" id="Page_166">166</span>
business will soon be settled, for I shall carry thy
water to a certain doctor, who will give such counsel
as I order.”</p>

<p>All was accomplished as arranged, for on the
morrow, as soon as it was dawn, the girl, who was
sleeping with her husband, fell to complaining and
feigning sickness as though a strong fever racked
her body.</p>

<p>Her foolish husband was much vexed and
astonished, and knew not what to say or do. He sent
forthwith for his mother-in-law, who was not long in
coming. As soon as he saw her he said:</p>

<p>“Alas! mother! thy daughter is dying!”</p>

<p>“My daughter?” quoth she. “What doth she
want?” And while she spoke, she walked to the
patient’s chamber.</p>

<p>As soon as the mother perceived her daughter,
she inquired of her as to her trouble, and the girl,
being well instructed in what she must do, answered
not at first, but, after a while, said:</p>

<p>“Mother, I am dying.”</p>

<p>“Please God, thou shalt not die! Take courage!
But how cometh it that thou art fallen ill so
suddenly?”</p>

<p>“I know not! I know not!” answered the
girl. “Thou dost madden me by these questions.”</p>

<p>The mother took the daughter’s hand, and felt
her pulse, her body and her head; then she said to
her son-in-law:</p>

<p>“In sooth, she is sorely ill. She is on fire. We
must find some remedy. Hast aught of her water?”</p>

<p>“That which she made last night is there,”
said one of the attendants.</p>

<p>“Give it me,” said the mother.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_167">167</span></p>

<p>She took the urine, and put it in a proper
vessel, and told her son-in-law that she would show
it to a physician, that he might know what he might
do to her daughter to cure her.</p>

<p>“For God’s sake! spare naught!” she said.
“I have still some money, but I love my daughter
better than money.”</p>

<p>“Spare!” said he. “If money can help, I will
not fail her.”</p>

<p>“When thou goest,<a id="FNanchor_110" href="#Footnote_110" class="fnanchor">110</a> and while she is resting,”
said the mother, “I will go home; but I will return an
I am needed.”</p>

<p>Now it should be known that the old woman
on the previous day, when she quitted her daughter,
had instructed the physician, who was well aware of
what he must say. So the young man carried his
wife’s water to the physician, and, having saluted
him, related how sick and suffering was his wife.</p>

<p>“And I have brought some of her water that
thou mayest judge how sick she is, and the more
easily cure her,” said the young man.</p>

<p>The physician took the vessel of urine, and,
turning it about and examining it, said:</p>

<p>“Thy wife is sore afflicted with illness and in
peril of death unless succour be forthcoming. Her
water showeth it.”</p>

<p>“Ah! master, for the love of God, tell me
what to do, and I will pay thee well canst thou restore
her to health and prevent her from dying!”</p>

<p>“She need not die an thou obeyest my commands,”
quoth the physician. “But if thou dost not
make haste, all the money in the world will not save<span class="pagenum" id="Page_168">168</span>
her from death.”</p>

<p>“Tell me, for Gods sake, what to do,” said
the other, “and I will do it.”</p>

<p>“She must have connection with a man or she
will die,” answered the physician.</p>

<p>“Connection with a man?” said the other.
“What is that?”</p>

<p>“It meaneth,” continued the doctor, “that thou
must mount on top of her, and speedily ram her three
or four times, or more if thou canst; otherwise, the
great heat which doth consume and kill her, will not
be extinguished.”</p>

<p>“That will be good for her?”</p>

<p>“She is a dead woman,” answered the physician,
“an thou do it not and do it quickly.”</p>

<p>“By St. John!” said the other, “I will try
what I can do.”</p>

<p>With that he went home and found his wife,
who was groaning and lamenting loudly.</p>

<p>“How art thou, beloved?” asked he.</p>

<p>“I die, beloved,” answered she.</p>

<p>“Please God, thou shalt not die,” said he. “I
have conversed with the physician, who hath told
me what medicine will cure thee.”</p>

<p>And, as he spoke, he fell to undressing, and
lay down beside his wife, and began to execute in
clumsy fashion the orders he had received from the
physician.</p>

<p>“What dost thou?” asked his wife. “Wouldst
kill me?”</p>

<p>“Nay, I am about to cure thee,” said he. “The
physician hath assured me.”</p>

<p>And Nature instructing and the patient assisting,
he performed upon her twice or thrice. When<span class="pagenum" id="Page_169">169</span>
resting from his labours, much astonished at what
had befallen, he asked his wife how she was.</p>

<p>“I am a little better than I was hitherto,” she
replied.</p>

<p>“God be praised,” quoth he. “I hope thou
wilt get well and that the physician hath spoken
truly.”</p>

<p>And with that he fell to again.</p>

<p>To cut matters short, he performed so well
that his wife was cured in a few days, whereat he was
very joyful, as was the mother when she knew of it.</p>

<p>Ever afterwards our Champenois became a
better fellow than heretofore, and his wife being now
restored to health, he one day invited all his friends
and relatives to dine with him, and also the father
and mother of his wife, and he served good cheer after
his own fashion. They drank to him, and he drank
to them, and he was right good company.</p>

<p>But hear what befell him. In the midst of the
feast he fell to weeping, which much astonished all
his friends who were at table with him; and they
demanded what was the matter, but he could not
answer for weeping scalding tears. At length he
spake, saying:</p>

<p>“I have good cause to weep.”</p>

<p>“By my oath thou hast not!” replied his
mother-in-law. “What aileth thee? Thou art rich
and powerful and well-housed, and hast good friends,
nor must thou forget thy fair and good wife, whom
God brought back to health when she was on the
verge of the grave. In my thinking thou shouldst be
light-hearted and joyous.”</p>

<p>“Alas!” said he. “Woe is me! My father
and mother, who both loved me, and who amassed<span class="pagenum" id="Page_170">170</span>
and bequeathed me so much wealth, are dead, and
by my fault, for they died of a fever, and had I well
touzled<a id="FNanchor_111" href="#Footnote_111" class="fnanchor">111</a> them both when they were ill, as I did my
wife, they would still be on their feet.”</p>

<p>There was none at table who, on hearing this,
would not fain have laughed; nevertheless, all restrained
themselves as best they might. The tables
were removed and each went his way, and the young
man continued to live with his wife, and, in order
that she might remain in good health, he failed not to
tail her pretty often.</p>

<h2 title="THE PRIEST AND THE LABOURER.">THE PRIEST AND THE LABOURER.<a id="FNanchor_112" href="#Footnote_112" class="fnanchor">112</a></h2>


<div>
  <img class="drop-cap" src="images/o.jpg" alt="" />
</div>
<p class="drop-cap">Once on a time there dwelt a priest and his
wife; they had two daughters. The priest
hired a labourer, and in the spring he made
a pilgrimage; but before setting out he gave
his orders to the labourer.</p>

<p>“See, friend,” said the priest, “on my return I
would find all the garden dug up and the beds set
out.”</p>

<p>“I hear, little father,” answered the labourer.</p>

<p>The labourer dug so ill that the garden went
to wrack and ruin, and all the while he enjoyed himself.
When the priest returned, he went to the garden
and saw that naught had been done.</p>

<p>“Ah, friend,” asked the priest of the labourer,
“is it possible that thou knowest not how to dig a
garden?”</p>

<p>“Assuredly I know not,” answered the
labourer. “Had I known I would have done it.”</p>

<p>“Go, then, into the house, and beg of my
daughters to give thee an iron shovel, and I will show
thee how to dig.”</p>

<p>The labourer sped to the house and sought
the daughters.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_172">172</span></p>

<p>“Little mistresses,” quoth he, “the little father
orders ye to give me ... both of ye....”</p>

<p>“Give thee what?”</p>

<p>“Ye know well he meaneth ye yourselves ...
to futter!”</p>

<p>The priest’s daughters fell to abusing the
labourer.</p>

<p>“What availeth it to abuse me?” asked the
labourer. “The little father hath ordered ye to yield
me this at once, for the borders of the garden must be
dug. An ye believe not me, ask of him yourselves.”</p>

<p>One of the daughters straightway ran to the
steps leading to the house, and cried:</p>

<p>“Little father! Hast ordered us to give this
thing to the labourer?”</p>

<p>“Give it him swiftly! Why keepest him
waiting?” answered the priest.</p>

<p>“Come, my sister,” said the young girl when
she returned. “There is no help for it. We must give
it him. So the little father hath ordered.”</p>

<p>Both then went to bed, and the labourer put
the matter through most expeditiously. Afterwards,
he took a shovel from the shed, and ran to the little
father in the garden. The priest showed him how to
dig the borders of the garden, and he himself returned
to the house to his wife. But what saw he? His
daughters in tears.</p>

<p>“Why weep ye?”</p>

<p>“How should we not weep, little father,”
answered they, “when thou thyself hast ordered the
labourer to make mock of us?”</p>

<p>“To make mock of ye?”</p>

<p>“Didst not order us to yield it to him?”</p>

<p>“And why not? I ordered ye to give him a<span class="pagenum" id="Page_173">173</span>
shovel.”</p>

<p>“A shovel? He hath dishonoured us! He
hath taken our virginity!”</p>

<p>When the priest heard this, he fell into a
mighty rage, seized a stake, and ran headlong to the
kitchen garden. The labourer perceived the priest
approaching with a stake. Wretched mischance! He
hurled the shovel from him and took to his heels. The
priest sped after him, but the labourer was the more
agile, and vanished from the sight of the priest.</p>

<p>Then went the priest in search of his labourer,
and in his search he encountered a peasant.</p>

<p>“Good day, friend,” said the priest.</p>

<p>“Good day, little father,” answered the peasant.</p>

<p>“Hast encountered my labourer?”</p>

<p>“I know not. A lad passed me, running
swiftly.”</p>

<p>“Tis he! Come with me, little peasant, and
aid me in the search. I will pay thee well.”</p>

<p>They set out together; not far off they came
upon a strolling player.</p>

<p>“Good day, strolling player,” said the priest.</p>

<p>“Good day, little father,” answered the strolling
player.</p>

<p>“Hast met a lad just now?”</p>

<p>“Yea, little father. There was one who went
running past me.”</p>

<p>“‘Tis he! Aid us in the search. I will pay
thee well.”</p>

<p>“Willingly, little father.”</p>

<p>And the three set forth together.</p>

<p>Now the labourer had run to the village, and
having clad himself in other garments, went himself
to meet the priest. And the priest failed to recognise<span class="pagenum" id="Page_174">174</span>
him, but questioned him, saying:</p>

<p>“Tell me, friend&mdash;hast seen a labourer on the
road?”</p>

<p>“I have seen one, and he ran to the village.”</p>

<p>“Come, friend, aid us in the search.”</p>

<p>“Willingly, little father.”</p>

<p>All four then went in search of the priest’s
labourer; they entered the village; they walked; they
walked unto eventide; naught befell. Darkness
descended. Where might they pass the night?</p>

<p>Anon they came to a house where dwelt a
widow, and they begged leave of her to pass the night
therein.</p>

<p>“Good people,” replied the widow, “there will
be a deluge this night in my house. I warn ye of it
beforehand. Ye will be drowned.”</p>

<p>Howbeit, she did not refuse them&mdash;indeed,
she might not&mdash;and she let them enter for the night.</p>

<p>(Now the widow’s lover had promised to visit
her that night.)</p>

<p>All four then entered the house and betook
themselves to bed. The priest, thinking perchance
there might be a deluge, laid hold of a great trough,
set it upon a shelf, and put himself to sleep in the
trough.</p>

<p>“If there be a deluge,” thought he to himself,
“I shall float upon the top of it in the trough.”</p>

<p>The strolling player laid himself down by the
hearth, his head in the ashes; the peasant reclined on
the bench behind the table; and the priest’s labourer
stretched himself on the stool by the window. Hardly
had they lain down ere they fell into deep slumber,
excepting the labourer, who alone slept not. He it
was who heard the lover of the mistress of the house<span class="pagenum" id="Page_175">175</span>
come beneath the window and knock, saying:</p>

<p>“Open, my beloved.”</p>

<p>The labourer arose, opened the window, and
spake in low tones, saying:</p>

<p>“Beloved, thou comest at an ill moment.
Strangers are within my house, passing the night
therein. Come thou the next night.”</p>

<p>“I go, beloved,” answered the lover. “But
lean thou from the window that we may embrace.”</p>

<p>The labourer turned his posterior to the window
and thrust out his backside. The lover embraced
it with rapture.</p>

<p>“I go ... adieu, my beloved. Fare thee well.
I will return to-morrow night.”</p>

<p>“Go, loved one. I will await thee, but, as a
parting gift, give me thy yard, which I will hold for
several moments in my hand. ‘Twill console me
somewhat.”</p>

<p>The lover drew forth his yard from his
drawers and thrust it towards the window.</p>

<p>“Take it, beloved,” quoth he. “Amuse thyself.”</p>

<p>The labourer took the yard in his hand,
caressed it once or twice, drew his knife from his
pocket, and, with one blow, cut off the member and
testicles of the lover. The latter uttered a great cry,
and sped amain to his home. The labourer shut the
window, sat down on the bench, and made a noise
with his mouth, as though eating. The peasant heard
the noise and awoke, saying:</p>

<p>“What eatest thou, comrade?”</p>

<p>“I have found a morsel of sausage on the
table, but I cannot eat it all, for ‘tis uncooked.”</p>

<p>“No matter if it be uncooked, comrade. Give<span class="pagenum" id="Page_176">176</span>
me a portion to sample.”</p>

<p>“There is not much, friend, but take what is
left and eat.” And he gave him the cut-off yard.</p>

<p>The peasant fell to chewing the ‘sausage’ with
fine appetite. He chewed and chewed, but could not
swallow the morsel.</p>

<p>“What is wrong with it, comrade?” he asked.
“‘Tis impossible to eat it. ‘Tis so tough.”</p>

<p>“Put it in the frying-pan, roast it, and then
thou wilt be able to eat it.”</p>

<p>The peasant arose, went towards the frying-pan,
and crammed the ‘sausage’ right ‘twixt the teeth
of the strolling player. He held it there; he held it
there for a long while, making experiment with it.</p>

<p>“Nay,” said he, at length. “The ‘sausage’
hath not grown tender. The fire hath done naught.”</p>

<p>“Cease to wrestle with the thing,” said the
labourer. “The mistress of the house will hear and
will scold us. Thou hast scattered the fire over the
frying-pan. Look! sprinkle it with water that the
woman may perceive naught.”</p>

<p>“But where may I get the water?”</p>

<p>“Piss o’er it. Better extinguish the fire than
have to go forth into the courtyard.”</p>

<p>The peasant had great desire to piss, and he
pissed forthwith upon the face of the strolling player.
And when the strolling player felt the water, coming
whence he knew not, fall right in his mouth, he said:</p>

<p>“The deluge hath arrived!”</p>

<p>And he fell to crying with all the strength of
his lungs:</p>

<p>“Little father! The deluge! The deluge!”</p>

<p>The priest heard the voice of the strolling
player, and, half asleep, sought to cast himself, together<span class="pagenum" id="Page_177">177</span>
with the trough, straight into the water, but instead
he fell heavily on the ground, bruising himself all
over.</p>

<p>“Ah! my God!” he cried. “When a child
falleth, the good Lord placeth a cushion under it, but
when an old man tumbleth, the devil putteth a harrow
beneath him. Behold me all sore and bruised. Of a
certainty I shall ne’er find that brigand of a labourer.”</p>

<p>Quoth the labourer to the priest:</p>

<p>“Seek him no more, I counsel thee. Go home,
and may the Lord go with thee. It were better for thy
health.”</p>

<h3><i>EXCURSUS</i> to <i>THE PRIEST AND THE
LABOURER</i>.</h3>

<p>The foregoing story reminds one of the device
employed by “The Youth who would Futter his
Father’s Wives,” (<cite>The Thousand Nights and a Night:
Supplemental Nights</cite>, vol. 6: Translated by Sir Richard
F. Burton.) In the latter case the father sets out on a
journey, but, having forgotten his shoes, instructs his
son, who is accompanying him for a short way, to
return and fetch them. The youth goes back, informs
his father’s wives that they are to sleep with him in
his parent’s absence, and, when they are incredulous,
shouts to his father in the distance:</p>

<p>“O my papa, one of them or the two of
them?”</p>

<p>The father, referring, of course, to his shoes,
shouts back:</p>

<p>“The two! The two!”</p>

<p>The wives are convinced by this remark, as
were the virgin daughters of the priest in our story
from <cite>Kruptadia</cite>. We shall reserve further extracts
from this Oriental narrative for a subsequent volume
of <em>Anthologica Rarissima</em>, the plot and details being

<h2 title="THE TWO LOVERS AND THE TWO SISTERS.">THE TWO LOVERS AND THE TWO
SISTERS.<a id="FNanchor_113" href="#Footnote_113" class="fnanchor">113</a></h2>


<div>
  <img class="drop-cap" src="images/i.jpg" alt="" />
</div>
<p class="drop-cap">I will tell you, therefore, that in those days
when Duke Ranier of Anjou, envious of the
peace and quiet, as well as of the power and
the wisdom of that divine prince, King Don
Alfonso, was driven from Naples and from the Kingdom,
it pleased him to tarry for a certain season in
Florence. There were, amongst the other Frenchmen
who were involved in the ruin and shipwreck of his
fortunes, two valiant and accomplished cavaliers, the
one named Filippo de Lincurto and the other Ciarlo
d’Amboia.</p>

<p>Now these two, although they were very
prudent and endowed with many virtues, were inclined
nevertheless, being young and given over to
love, to leave the burden of disaster, and the cares
thereof as well, to him who was especially concerned
with the same, that is, to the duke.</p>

<p>It happened that in their daily rides through
Florence Filippo fell deeply in love with a graceful
and very lovely young lady of noble parentage, and
wife to a citizen of repute; and while he strove in<span class="pagenum" id="Page_180">180</span>cessantly
to win her, it chanced that Ciarlo, as he
ranged another part of the city, became enamoured
of a sister of Filippo’s lady-love, who abode unmarried
in her father’s house. He, unwitting of this kinship,
made up his mind, albeit he deemed her passing fair,
to keep his passion within sober limits, forasmuch as
he was well versed in the strife of love and aware that
young damsels are wont to love lightly and without
constancy. Filippo, finding that his fair lady was
discreet and of good understanding, and being also
fully prepared to become her servant, resolved to give
her his love entirely; on which account the lady,
realizing his humour and considering his many and
praiseworthy parts, likewise determined to recompense
him with all the love of her heart, and began to
favour him with her kindness in such wise that he
saw she was the only woman in the world who knew
how to love.</p>

<p>She, certes, would have let him taste at once
the supreme fruit of love had she not been restrained
therefrom by the continual presence of her husband;
so, having given Filippo assurance, both by letter
and by messages, that she was firmly set in this
purpose, the two lovers longed beyond aught else for
the time when the husband would take his departure
to Flanders in the galley which was now expected at
any hour to touch at Pisa.</p>

<p>While they thus abode in pleasureable expectation,
Duke Ranier was obliged to return to
France, whereat both the cavaliers felt mightily
aggrieved, and especially that one of the two who
loved and likewise was loved in return; nevertheless,
being bound by necessity, they took their departure,
snared as they were in amorous toils.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_181">181</span></p>

<p>Filippo swore to his lady that no obstacle,
however great, should debar him from returning, and
that, come what might, he as a loyal lover would
never forsake her. Having consoled her with other
speeches yet more affectionate, he and his companion
set forth; and after his return it came to pass in the
course of time, either through some fresh fancy or
through the cares of business, that Filippo, albeit he
still remembered the lady left behind, let the ardent
flames of his passion grow colder every day. He not
only forgot his promise to return, but beyond this
neglected to answer any of the many letters writ to
him by the lady.</p>

<p>On this account she, perceiving how she was
well-nigh forsaken by this lover once so ardent, was
stricken with such cruel grief thereanent that she
almost lost her wits; but, calling to mind the stainless
virtue of the cavalier, she could not persuade herself
that so noble a heart could harbour such inhumanity.
However, when she remembered his latest words,
both written and sent to her by the mouth of their
trusted messenger, she deliberated how she might by
a new and suggestive plan stimulate the virtue of her
lover and thereby make a final trial on behalf of her
passion.</p>

<p>Thus she caused to be made by a skilled
master a ring of gold, wrought very finely, and in this
she had set a counterfeit diamond, most manifestly
false, letting engrave round the ring itself the words,
‘La ma za batani?’<a id="FNanchor_114" href="#Footnote_114" class="fnanchor">114</a> This, after she had wrapped it in
fine cambric, she sent to her Filippo by a certain
young man of Florence, who knew how things stood
with her, and who was going to France after his own<span class="pagenum" id="Page_182">182</span>
affairs, charging him that he should himself deliver
it to Filippo with no farther words than these: “She
who loves you and you only sends you this, and
implores you to let her have a fitting answer thereto.”</p>

<p>In due time the envoy with his offering and
his message arrived at Filippo’s house and was joyfully
received; but after the cavalier had marked with
amazement what was the quality of the ring, and
what the motto graven thereupon, he went about for
several days pondering over the purport of the same,
and finding himself unable to draw from it the true
meaning, he determined to show it to Ciarlo and to
divers other gentlemen of the court; but these, taken
singularly and altogether, what though they used all
their wits, were unable to hit the mark.</p>

<p>Finally its meaning was fathomed by Duke
John, who was a gentleman of great discretion, albeit
more fortunate in advising others than in reaping
victory in the many enterprises he undertook. What
it said was this:</p>

<p>“False diamond, why hast thou forsaken
me?”</p>

<p>When Filippo heard this sentence he saw at
once how the lady had most justly and prudently
reproved him for his lover’s unfaith, and began to
consider how he might by a device of the same sort
answer so graceful a proposition and repay so heavy
a debt of love. So, being minded to conclude the
matter, he went to his dear friend Ciarlo, beseeching
him by the friendship there was between them, that
he would go with him to Florence for the reason
aforesaid.</p>

<p>And albeit Ciarlo found this somewhat hard
at first, he ended by consenting to oblige so dear a<span class="pagenum" id="Page_183">183</span>
friend, deeming besides that he might peradventure
thereby compass some pleasure for himself and for
the damsel he loved. Thereupon they set forth, and
having duly come to Florence, they began at the first
chance to walk past the houses of their ladies in order
to signify their presence; and Filippo soon sent word
by his wonted messenger to his lady how he had
sufficiently understood the message which the ring
sent by her had borne, and how he knew no other
method of disproving her false opinion of him save
by bearing witness for himself, wherefore it behoved
her to grant him an interview meet for the occasion.</p>

<p>The gracious lady, who with her sister had
rejoiced amain over the return of their lovers, and had
deliberated what course should be taken, as soon as
she heard this kindly message, so manifestly springing
from love, was filled with such joy that she felt
almost jealous of herself, and so as to lose no more
time over the matter she sent back a brief answer to
Filippo, bidding him wait with his companion before
the door of her house next evening.</p>

<p>Wherefore Filippo, as soon as the hour had
come, betook himself merrily with his friend Ciarlo
to the spot which had been named, and there they
caught sight of the lady, who gave them most gladsome
reception. After she had made a trusty maidservant
of hers open to them the door and bring them
in, she likewise gave them to understand, by the
mouth of this same woman, that the only way in
which the thing she so much desired could be brought
about would be that, while she should be taking her
pleasure with Filippo, Messer Ciarlo should go and
strip naked and lie down in the bed beside her husband,
in order that, if by chance the husband should<span class="pagenum" id="Page_184">184</span>
wake and feel Ciarlo in bed, he might believe that
his wife was still there.</p>

<p>Unless he should consent to do this, they
would all run great peril of their honour and of their
lives as well; wherefore she besought them to put in
practice the timely stratagem which she had provided,
or else withdraw from the place forthwith.</p>

<p>As soon as Ciarlo heard this request, what
though he would have gone down to hell to serve his
comrade, he was conscious that, even if the business
should come to a fortunate issue, it would be to him
a great loss of good fame were he to be found there
stark naked; wherefore he refused altogether to go on
such service in such fashion, declaring, however, that
if he might go clad and carrying his sword in his
hand he would willingly do what they wanted.</p>

<p>Now Filippo had travelled all the way from
France to foregather with his lady-love, and, in considering
the difficult parts to which they had come,
he perceived that his friend was speaking and that
the lady was acting with good show of reason; so, after
many and divers arguments, for the reason that the
lady remained firmly fixed in her purpose and that
he himself was more than ever fired with amorous
desire, he besought Ciarlo almost with tears that,
by the bonds of friendship, he would consent to
oblige them, what though the thing itself might be
unseemly.</p>

<p>Therefore Ciarlo, seeing how great was the
passion which possessed his friend, and to what a
pass the affair had come, determined that he would if
need be meet death itself rather than be wanting in
service to Filippo.</p>

<p>Thereupon the waiting-woman taking Ciarlo<span class="pagenum" id="Page_185">185</span>
by the hand led him in the dark to the lady, and she,
having given him kindly welcome, took him into her
own chamber, and there bade him take off all his
clothes and get into the bed, keeping his sword at
hand. Then she softly bade him be of good heart and
have patience, for she would soon return and release
him. This done, she went full of joy to her Filippo,
and having led him into another room they reaped
the full and delightful fruit of their desire.</p>

<p>Now when Ciarlo had waited, not two, but
four hours, he began to think that it was full time for
the lady, or at least for his trusty comrade, to come
and set him free; so, hearing no one coming, and
perceiving that it was near daybreak, he said to himself:</p>

<p>“If these others, all afire with love, feel no
concern at having left me here to play a fool’s part, it
is now full time for me to take thought of myself and
of my honour.”</p>

<p>Having softly got out of bed, himseeming
that the lady’s husband was asleep, he went with the
sheet over his shoulders to try to escape, but was
hugely annoyed at finding the chamber door securely
locked outside; and, not knowing where the windows
were, nor on what place they looked, he went back to
the bed in a fury.</p>

<p>He heard sounds which told him that the
other occupant of the bed was awake and moving,
and, though he was pricked both by fear and curiosity,
he kept aloof and spake not a word. While he was
thus troubled in mind he marked through the fissures
of the windows that it was now broad day, and, fearing
amain lest he should be espied by his bed-partner,
he turned his back, and, gathering himself together<span class="pagenum" id="Page_186">186</span>
and keeping his sword ready for his needs, he resolved
to leave whatever might befall him to Fortune,
and kept still, mightily troubled in mind.</p>

<p>Before long he heard sounds of the fires being
kindled throughout the house, and the hasty steps of
the servants as they ran to fetch water; wherefore he
determined at the last rather to die as beseemed a good
cavalier than to be found there stark naked and
making shift for a woman; so, having leapt out of
bed with his drawn sword, he went to the door, and,
as he was using all his force to open the same, he
became aware how someone was unfastening it from
without.</p>

<p>He drew back somewhat, and then saw enter
Filippo, laughing heartily and holding the lady by
the hand. The two straightway began to embrace
him in merry wise, albeit they saw he was bursting
with rage. But when the lady perceived that he was
all bemused, and unwitting where he was, she took
him by the hand and said to him:</p>

<p>“My good sir, by the sincere love I bear
towards you, and also by that which you have towards
certain others, I will assure myself that I may
speak to you concerning a matter which intimacy
such as ours will allow us to discuss. I know not
whether Nature may have failed to bestow upon you
French gentlemen that which she always gives to the
lower animals. I mean to say that I know of no male
beast, whether wild or tame, which, when under the
sway of love, will not recognise the female by her
odour. And you, forsooth, a wise and discreet gentleman,
who have come hither all the way from France
on account of love, can it be that your frozen nature
is so sluggish that, when Fortune lets you spend the<span class="pagenum" id="Page_187">187</span>
whole of a long night by the side of her for whom
you have shown such great tokens of love, you failed
to scent out who she was?”</p>

<p>Then, having led him up to the bedside, she
let him see and know clearly that it was her sister
and no one else who had lain beside him during the
night which was just passed.</p>

<p>When he perceived this thing the cavalier
was not a little ashamed of himself, but finally all
four laughed and joked so merrily that they could
scarce stand upright on their feet; and because of the
pass to which things had come, it seemed meet to all
that, for the setting right of the fault aforesaid, they
should once more divide in pairs.</p>

<p>Whereupon Ciarlo, having got back into bed,
plucked the fresh flower and the earliest fruit of the
goodly garden which fell to his lot, and the two friends
remained there, each taking delight with his own lady,
until the husband came back from western parts.</p>

<p>Quoting from Mérard de Saint-Just, (<cite>Espiègleries
Joyeusetés</cite>), Poggio’s translator gives a variant
in verse of the foregoing story. We reproduce it in

<p>“Pierre the Red, wrapped in his bed-clothes,
felt himself stimulated by the burning flame of the
god of love, and he invited his wife to come straightway
to his arms. It chanced that she was praying,
and she made reply: ‘Wait a while.’ And whilst her
<i lang="la">Paters</i> and her <i lang="la">Agnus’</i> and her <i lang="la">Aves</i> were accomplished,
Pierre’s ardour had had time to grow cold. She
entered the bed, but the chilled husband maintained
his pretence. She drew near him; he did not budge.
‘Beloved, what dost wish? I have said my prayers.’&mdash;’Good,’
quoth Pierre the Red. ‘But I have grown
soft.’”</p>

<p class="drop-cap">An old man had a son, a fine lad. Another old
man had a daughter, a marriageable girl.
They pictured these two young ones married.</p>

<p>“Ivanouchka,” said the father, “I desire thee
to marry the daughter of our neighbour; approach
her and discourse gently and courteously with her.”</p>

<p>“Machoutka,” said the other old man, “I
would give thee in marriage to the son of our neighbour;
seek to meet him and have pleasant converse
with him.”</p>

<p>These two young persons met in the street
and greeted each other.</p>

<p>“Ivanouchka,” quoth the young girl, “my
father hath bade me have pleasant discourse with
thee.”</p>

<p>“My father hath instructed me likewise,”
answered the youth.</p>

<p>“What shall we do? Where sleepest thou,
Ivanouchka?”</p>

<p>“In the hay.”</p>

<p>“As for me,” quoth the girl, “I sleep in the
coach-house. Come this night to me, and we will<span class="pagenum" id="Page_194">194</span>
hold pleasant converse together.”</p>

<p>Thus it was. During the night Ivanouchka
went and lay down with Machoutka.</p>

<p>“Camest thou by the threshing-floor?” asked
she.</p>

<p>“Yea. Hast thou seen the heap of dung?”</p>

<p>“I have seen it.”</p>

<p>“What shall we do now?”<a id="FNanchor_119" href="#Footnote_119" class="fnanchor">119</a></p>

<p>“I must see if thou hast a good instrument.”</p>

<p>“Come, look,” said he, and undid his drawers.
“Behold my riches!”</p>

<p>“‘Tis too big for me! See how small is mine!”</p>

<p>“Let me see if mine will go in.”</p>

<p>And the youth set himself to make the trial;
his yard rose up erect like a stake, and when he thrust
it in, the young girl cried with all her might:</p>

<p>“Ah! that hurteth me! How it biteth!”</p>

<p>“Have no fear. My yard hath not sufficient
room; for that reason it is so angry.”</p>

<p>“I told thee that there was not sufficient
space for it.”</p>

<p>“Wait&mdash;it will stretch.”</p>

<p>Anon, when he made her to feel much
pleasure, she said to him:</p>

<p>“Ah! my little heart! Thy riches are indeed
worth much money.”</p>

<p>They performed and fell asleep.</p>

<p>But the girl awoke during the night, and
kissed the backside of the young man, which she
took for his face. He let her do this to satiety, and the
girl said to him:</p>

<p>“Knowest thou, Vania, that thou smellest
most scurvily!”</p>

<p class="drop-cap">Once on a time there lived alone in a lodging
near St. Ives a young man. ‘Twas at the
time when the debate was running high
‘twixt the monks and the ministers whether
‘twere better to say: “Blessed are they that have
dined well,” or, “Blessed are they that laugh.” The
young man took but scant interest in these theological
discussions, and devoted his attention to the maid,
who was a fine enough young thing, though somewhat
green. He would talk with her coolly and discreetly,
and one day said:</p>

<p>“Thou art from the country, little friend?”</p>

<p>“Truly, sir.”</p>

<p>“I was assured of it and shall love thee none
the less: thou art a good girl and a good housekeeper.”</p>

<p>“I thank thee kindly, sir.”</p>

<p>“Well, little friend, since I love thee so much,
and that thou mayst serve us well, I must e’en tell
thee, for thine own good profit, of a certain ill that
befalleth country maids when they come to dwell in
the town; ‘tis that small eggs do grow in their bellies<span class="pagenum" id="Page_196">196</span>
and harden there, so that these poor maids have to
show their posteriors to the doctor. I would grieve
shouldst thou come to that, and it shall not be so an
thou wilt hear me. I will do something for thee, and
I see that ‘tis full time to begin, for, by thy colour, I
can tell that the eggs are already there.”</p>

<p>“Indeed, sir, I am greatly beholden, for truly
I am not what I was.”</p>

<p>“To-morrow morning I will give thee something
for this malady.”</p>

<p>When morning came, she went to his chamber
and he gave her a spoonful of white hypocras,<a id="FNanchor_121" href="#Footnote_121" class="fnanchor">121</a>
telling her to go about her house-work and, anon, to
break her fast on a little dry bread. This treatment
was continued for two or three days, but one morning,
when her mistress was out of the way, he took hold of
the maid and, laughing gently, pushed her against
the bed as if to look into her mouth.</p>

<p>“Alas! sir! what wouldst do?” she cried.</p>

<p>“I shall do thee no ill; I would break an egg
which is fast hardening.”</p>

<p>She let him do it, and he did it so well that
he put live flesh in live flesh.<a id="FNanchor_122" href="#Footnote_122" class="fnanchor">122</a> So he finished as soon
as he had begun, and she found the business so
much to her liking, although he had cooked her somewhat,
that she came back again and again to have the
eggs broken; in sooth, she had wished for a belly in<span class="pagenum" id="Page_197">197</span>
which one might break eggs for an hundred years
without doing aught else.</p>

<p>One day she loitered over long at this pleasant
pursuit, and her mistress fell to scolding her when
she descended, saying:</p>

<p>“Thou sly wench! Thou hast been in
mischief with that man above! Idiot! Little hussy!
What hast been about up there?”</p>

<p>“Naught, madam. Be not wroth; ‘tis as I
shall tell thee.”</p>

<p>“Thou hast been after no good with that man
above.”</p>

<p>“Nay, madam, thou dost him wrong; he is
the most honest man in the world. I had eggs in my
belly, and he broke them for me.”</p>

<p>“Eggs, thou slut! what eggs?”</p>

<p>“Behold, madam, if ‘tis not so; I will lift my
smock; thou canst see my front part, which is yet all
damp with the white of the eggs, which came out
when he broke them.”</p>

<h3><i>EXCURSUS</i> to <i>THE BREAKER OF EGGS</i>.</h3>

<p><cite>Le Moyen de Parvenir</cite> of Béroalde de Verville,
Canon of St. Gatien at Tours, once a Hugenot, then
a Catholic, finally “neither one nor the other,”<a id="FNanchor_123" href="#Footnote_123" class="fnanchor">123</a> is a
work little known to the English reader, be he student
or bibliophile. The cause is not far to seek; no <em>complete</em>
and <em>unexpurgated</em> English translation of this
much censured book exists. Machen’s rendering,
while claiming to be the first in our language, is in
no sense full and literal, although free and full-flavoured;
the translator, as he admits in his humourous
preface, “has been forced, much to his sorrow, to
weed out some strongly-scented flowers from this
Canonical Garden.” His text, indeed, shows many
notable omissions, in particular the more licentious
asides and interjections which have no actual bearing
on the stories; further, there are sundry additions
not found in the old French text&mdash;“odd scraps from
his own workshop,” as Machen terms them.</p>

<p>For the student, then, there are: Machen’s
delightful (but <em>partial</em>) translation, limited to 500
numbered copies and now a rare book,<a id="FNanchor_124" href="#Footnote_124" class="fnanchor">124</a> and numerous<span class="pagenum" id="Page_199">199</span>
editions in <em>old</em> French, some expurgated, and all
difficult of understanding where the average English
reader is concerned. As we note in the preface to
Garnier’s latest issue, the work, for the greater part,
“is an enigma to modern readers and contains a
crowd of obscurities ... it would need volume after
volume to explain and comment upon everything
that calls for explanation and comment.”</p>

<p><cite>The Way to Attain</cite> or <cite>The Right Way with
Women</cite> (the title of de Verville’s book has suffered
various translations) would seem to have a dual
personality; one: a clear-cut collection of stories,
witty, realistic, free, Rabelaisian, or obscene as you
choose to term them; another: the same stories, enmeshed
in a mass of innuendo, obscure sayings,
licentious and scatalogical asides, and&mdash;sometimes&mdash;almost
meaningless phraseology. The trouble is to
separate the grain from the chaff, the stories from the
irrelevant verbiage&mdash;not that the latter is not often
highly entertaining. Bernard de la Monnoye, in his
<cite>Dissertation</cite> (<i lang="la">cit. sup.</i>), bears out our criticism when
explaining the plan of the book. “The author supposes
a sort of general banquet,” he writes, “where, without
regard for rank or degree, he introduces persons of
every kind and age, scallawags for the most part,
who, with no object but their own amusement, talk
with the utmost freedom, and passing almost imperceptibly
from subject to subject, cause the stories to
be lost to sight. In fact, they are so jumbled up in
the book that one is hard put to find them....”</p>

<p>Both extracts from <cite>The Way to Attain</cite> given<span class="pagenum" id="Page_200">200</span>
in this volume (Coypeau and His Thread and The
Breaker of Eggs) are told without interruption in the
original French text, but each is introduced in the
most haphazard fashion, preceded and followed by a
veritable welter of inconsequent remarks; if Machen
found it necessary to weed out the most strongly
scented flowers from the Canonical garden, the
student will find it equally necessary to dig before
he finds the best.</p>

<p>There are other good things, however, besides
the stories in <cite>The Way to Attain</cite>. While many of the
asides and interjections are gross, vulgar, and, seemingly,
pointless, others show a pretty and pungent
wit. The canon is for ever having a thrust at his
cloth, the monks, and the nuns, and some of his
criticisms are worth repeating:&mdash;</p>

<p>“Where there are no monks there can be no
shamelessness.”</p>

<p>“None sit more at their ease than monks,
ministers, and consecrated folk, who, in the place of
keeping the holy orders that have been given them,
make them into ordure, and leaving the orders of God
take the orders of the devil, who giveth them grace to
be more lewd and whorish than other men.”</p>

<p>“The women that frequent the abodes of
churchmen are not their wives, ... they are first
maids, then mates, then mistresses.”</p>

<p>“It is better to have in one’s house a wench
with whom one can disport theologically than to go
about wandering from pillar to post like a high-toby,
and run the risk of getting a nip, like Cornu, who
sighed as he lay a-dying of the pox: ‘Now I begin to
appreciate the beauties of domesticity.’”</p>

<p>“Once on a time he was prebendary of<span class="pagenum" id="Page_201">201</span>
Chartres, but he left his stall to marry a pretty lass,
and the morning after the wedding, as they lay in bed,
he said to her: ‘Now, sweetheart, thou dost see how
well I love thee, for I left my fair prebend that I
might have thee.’ She replied: ‘Then thou wast a
fool; thou shouldst have kept thy prebend, and had
me also.’ ... It would appear that she knew that
some canons are given to waggery.”</p>

<p>“Such cloisterlings, who love not women, are
always ready to fish up some ancient, stinking heresy
under the pretence of discoursing against the Reformation,
talking of vices they impute to others, the
which are more tolerable than their own.... It is
better to keep a wench than to trouble the peace of
Christendom, and to do the work is true godliness,
which is the reason why bishops are called fathers-in-God, ... fathers-in-God
sounds better than fathers-in-law.
And they are certainly godly, that is happy;
for happy, thrice happy is the father who hath not the
trouble of feeding his children.”</p>

<p>“He was as liberal as our bishop, who had
rather give a crown to a wench than a groat to a poor
man.”</p>

<p>“Assuredly she is a strumpet. I saw her talking
to the curate of St. Paul’s, who had promised his
rector to be discreet, and run no more after the
wenches, or at least that he would abstain during
Easter week. But Lord! he hadn’t the patience, and
on Easter Monday he spoke to his woman, and the
parson saw him. When they met he told him of it,
saying: ‘I saw thee speaking to a wench. Where is
thy shame? Canst not refrain, at least during the
holy season?’ ‘Pardon,’ he replied, ‘I did but make<span class="pagenum" id="Page_202">202</span>
an appointment for next week.’”<a id="FNanchor_125" href="#Footnote_125" class="fnanchor">125</a></p>

<p>We have quoted sufficiently to show that
amid this welter of words there is fruit worth the
plucking. The general tone of the work, however, is
coarse; if the canon desired to refer to what is not
usually mentioned in the most Catholic of assemblies,
he did so in the crudest language. To our age the
grossness of his obscenity seems unnecessary; out of
place; unpardonable. Is it so? The conversational
atmosphere of a present-day smoking-room would
have made de Verville blush. The old canon wrote
as men in those times spoke; we of to-day write not
as we speak, but as we think we ought to speak. It is
this pitiful hypocrisy which blinds us to the fact that
in <cite>Le Moyen de Parvenir</cite> we have some of the
brightest tales and sayings ever penned by human
hand.</p>

“The Chinese ... have discovered a way of forming a
new virginity when by some accident that object has gone astray.
The method consists in astringent lotions applied to the parts, the
effect of which so draws them together that a certain amount of
vigour is required in order to pass through, the husband&mdash;on a
nuptial night&mdash;being convinced that he has overcome the usual
barrier. To make the illusion more complete, a leech-bite is made
just inside the critical part, and the little wound is plugged with a
minute pellet of vegetable tinder, with the result that the effort
made by the husband to overcome the difficulty displaces the
pellet and a slight flow of blood ensues.” (<cite>Curious Bypaths of
History</cite>, <i lang="la">op. cit. sup.</i>) That this method is by no means peculiar
to the Chinese is instanced by Brantôme in his <cite>Lives of Fair and
Gallant Ladies</cite> (Paris: Carrington, 1901: first English translation),
where the genial old soldier-philosopher says:&mdash;“How clever
these doctors be! for they do give women remedies to make them
appear virgin and intact as they were afore.... One such especially
I learned of a quack these last few days. Take leeches and apply
to the privy parts, getting them to drain and suck the blood in that
region. Now the leeches, in sucking, do engender and leave
behind little blebs or blisters full of blood. Then when the gallant
bridegroom cometh on his marriage night to give assault, he doth
burst these same blisters and the blood discharging from them; the
thing is all bathed in gore, to the great satisfaction of both the
twain; for so ‘the honour of the citadel is saved.’”</p></div>

“That this eagerness after virginity is not an original
lust, I must, indeed, prove from the opinion of a certain remote
people, who esteem the taking of a maidenhead as a laborious and
illiberal practice, which they delegate to men hired for that purpose,
ere themselves condescend to lie with their wives; who are returned
with disgrace to their friends, if it be discovered that they have
brought their virginity with them.”&mdash;<cite>The Battles of Venus</cite>: The
Hague, 1760, quoted by Pisanus Fraxi in his <cite>Index Librorum
Prohibitorum</cite>. <i lang="la">Vide</i> also <i lang="la">post</i> in this Study.</p></div>

<p><a id="Footnote_7" href="#FNanchor_7" class="label">7</a>
“Now as to these vows of virginity, Heliogabalus did
promulgate a law to the effect that no Roman maid, not even a
Vestal Virgin, was bound to perpetuate virginity, saying how that
the female sex was over weak for women to be bound to a pact
they could never be sure of keeping.” (Brantôme: <cite>Lives of Fair
and Gallant Ladies</cite>.) The author of this edict was not without a
knowledge of sexual psychology, for we have ample evidence that
some of the Vestals failed in their duty, which was, nominally, to
guard the sacred fire and the Holy Things of Rome. “Far up by
Porta Pia,” says F. Marion Crawford (<cite>Ave Roma Immortalis</cite>:
London, 1903), “over against the new Treasury, under a modern
street, lie the bones of guilty Vestals, buried living, each in a little
vault two fathoms deep, with the small dish and crust and the
earthen lamp that soon flickered out in the close, damp air.” Vestal
Virgins had many privileges denied to other Roman women; they
were free for life; they had a right to be present at the Emperor’s
games; and they were treated with marked respect by the highest
in the land. That the privileges of virginity did not necessarily
make for the owner’s happiness is instanced by Brantôme’s grim
story. “Maids and virgins,” he writes (<cite>Lives of Fair and Gallant
Ladies</cite>), “would seem in old days at Rome to have been highly
honoured and privileged, so much so that the law had no jurisdiction
over them to sentence them to death. Hence the story we
read of a Roman Senator in the time of the Triumvirate, which
was condemned to die among other victims of the Proscription,
and not he alone, but all the offspring of his loins. So when a
daughter of his house did appear on the scaffold, a very fair and
lovely girl, but of unripe years and yet a virgin, ‘twas needful for
the executioner to deflower her himself and take her maidenhead
on the scaffold, and only then when she was so polluted, could he
ply his knife upon her. The Emperor Tiberius did delight in
having fair virgins thus publicly deflowered, and then put to
death,&mdash;a right villainous piece of cruelty, pardy!”</p></div>

<i>C.f.</i> Herodotus, who tells us that in the fifth century
before Christ every woman, once in her life, had to come to the
temple of Mylitta, the Babylonian Venus, and yield herself to the
first stranger who threw a coin in her lap, in worship of the goddess.
The money could not be refused, however small the amount, but
it was given as an offertory to the temple, and the woman, having
followed the man and thus made oblation to Mylitta, returned
home and lived chastely ever afterwards. (Havelock Ellis: <cite>Studies
in the Psychology of Sex</cite>: vol. 6: <cite>Sex in Relation to Society</cite>.)
Havelock Ellis has quoted Herodotus in relation to prostitution,
holding that its origin is to be found primarily in religious custom.
In our opinion, the practice also merits inclusion in a catalogue of
virginal folk-lore, and we are further justified in our view by the
statement that the woman who so yielded herself lived chastely
ever afterwards.</p></div>

“In old times we read of a custom in the isle of Cyprus,
which ‘tis said the kindly goddess Venus, the patroness of that
land, did introduce. This was that the maids of that island should
go forth and wander along the banks, shores and cliffs of the sea,
for to earn their marriage portions by the generous giving of their
bodies to mariners, sailors and seafarers along that coast. These
would put in to shore on purpose, very often indeed turning from
their straight course by compass to land there; and so taking their
pleasant refreshment with them, would pay handsomely, and
presently hie them away again to sea, for their part only too sorry
to leave such good entertainment behind. Thus would these fair
maids win their marriage dowers, some more, some less, some high,
some low, some grand, some lowly, according to the beauty, gifts
and carnal attractions of each damsel.” (Brantôme: <cite>Lives of Fair

“I am not surprised if the Phœnicians, according to St.
Athanasius, obliged their daughters, by severe laws, to suffer themselves
before marriage to be deflowered by valets, or also that the
Armenians, as Strabo relates, sacrificed their daughters in the
temple of the Goddess Anaitis, with the object of being eased of
their maidenheads, so as to be able afterwards to find advantageous
marriages suited to their condition; for one cannot describe what
exhaustion and what sufferings a man has to undergo in his first
action, at all events if the girl be narrow.... It is far sweeter to
have connection with a woman accustomed to the pleasures of love
than to caress one who has not yet known a man; for as we ask a
locksmith to ease the wards of a new lock he brings us, to save us
the trouble we might have the first day, so had the nations of
whom we spoke good reason for establishing such laws.” (Nicolas
Venette: <cite>La Génération de L’Homme, ou Tableau de L’Amour

“According to Festus, <em>Mutinus</em> is a god differing wholly
from Priapus, having a public sanctuary at Rome, where the statue
was placed sitting with <i lang="la">penis</i> erect. Newly mated girls were placed
in his lap, before being led away to their husbands, so that the
deity might appear to have foretasted their virginity, this being
supposed to render the bride fruitful.” (<cite>Priapeia</cite>: Cosmopoli, 1890.)

An old established practice whereby newly married
women are deflowered by others than their husbands, whether by priest, lord, or stranger. To discuss this relic of feudalism would
be beyond the scope of a note; it is summed up briefly in the idea
that the lord of a domain was entitled to exact tribute from his
subjects in the form of intercourse with every bride on the first
night of her marriage. Our readers are referred to Dr. Karl
Schmidt’s <cite>Jus Primæ Noctis (The Law of the First Night)</cite>, the most
comprehensive treatise on the subject.</p></div>

Brantôme, of course, has some pertinent remarks on the
subject. In his <cite>Lives of Fair and Gallant Ladies</cite>, he devotes the
seventh <cite>Discourse</cite> to the following topic: <cite>Concerning married women,
widows and maids,&mdash;to wit, which of these same be better than other
to love</cite>. “One day,” writes the genial philosopher, “when I was at
the Court of Spain at Madrid, and conversing with a very honourable
lady, ... she did chance to ask me this question following:&mdash;’Which
of the three had the greater heat of love: widow, wife or
maid?’ After myself had told her mine opinion she did in turn
give me hers in some such terms as these: ‘That albeit maids, with
all that heat of blood that is theirs, be right well disposed to love,
yet do they not love so well as wives and widows. This is because
of the great experience of the business the latter have, and the
obvious fact that supposing a man born blind, ... he can never
desire the gift of sight so strongly as he that has sweetly enjoyed
the same a while and then been deprived of it.’” Later, quoting
Boccaccio, Brantôme also says:&mdash;“The widow is more painstaking
of the pleasure of love an hundred fold than the virgin, seeing the
latter is all for dearly guarding her precious virginity and maidenhead.
Further, virgins be naturally timid, and above all in this
matter, awkward and inept to find the sweet artifices and pretty
complaisances required under divers circumstances in such
encounters. But this is not so with the widow, who is already well
practised, bold and ready in this art, having long ago bestowed and
given away what the virgin doth make so much ado about giving....
Beside all this, the maid doth dread this first assault of her
virginity, ... whereas widows have no such fear, but do submit
themselves very sweetly and gently, even when the assailant be of
the roughest.”</p></div>

<p><a id="Footnote_15" href="#FNanchor_15" class="label">15</a>
We can supplement these remarks by a further quotation
from that curious work already noticed, <cite>The Battles of Venus</cite>,
wherein we read: “This lust, then, after the <em>untouched</em> morsel, I
take not to be an original dictate of nature; but consequently to
result from much experience with women, which has been demonstrated
to lead to novelty of wishes from fastidious impotence....
Yet, in truth, I esteem the fruition of a virgin to be, with respect
both to the mind and body of the enjoyer, the highest aggravation
of sensual delight. In the first place, his fancy is heated with the
prospect of enjoying a woman, after whom he has perhaps long
sighed and has been in pursuit, who he thinks has never before
been in bed with a man, (in whose arms never before has man laid),
and in triumphing in the first sight of her virgin charms. This
precious operation, then, of fancy, has been shown in the highest
degree to prepare the body for enjoyment. Secondly, his body
perceives, in that of a virgin, the cause of the greatest aggravation
of delight. I mean not only in the coyness and resistance which
she makes to his efforts, but when he is on the point of accomplishing
them: when arrived, as the poet sings, ‘on the brink of
giddy rapture,’ when in pity to a tender virgin’s sufferings, he is
intreated not to break fiercely in, but to spare ‘fierce dilaceration
and dire pangs.’ The resistance which the small, and as yet unopened,
mouth of bliss makes to his eager endeavours, serves only,
and that on a physical principle, to strengthen the instrument of
his attack, and concurs, with the instigation of his ardent fancy, to
reinforce his efforts, to unite all the co-operative powers of enjoyment,
and to produce an emission copious, rapid, and transporting....
‘In this case, part of the delight arises from considering that
... you feel the convulsive wrigglings of the chaste nymph you
have so long adored....’” Our acknowledgements are again due
to Pisanus Fraxi, from whose <cite>Index Librorum Prohibitorum</cite> our
extract is taken. The author of <cite>The Battles of Venus</cite>, it need hardly
be said, is in no sense an authority; his work, indeed, is pornographic
rather than artistic; at the same time, it is impossible to
ignore his flashes of insight into a question which has exercised
the minds of the greatest psychologists.</p></div>

Brantôme, apparently, had a poor opinion of Spartan
virginity. “What kind of virtue was it?” he asks. (<cite>Lives of Fair and
Gallant Ladies.</cite>) “Why! on their solemn feast-days the Spartan
maids were used to sing and dance in public stark naked with the
lads, and even wrestle in the open market place,&mdash;the which
however was done in all honesty and good faith, so History saith.
But what sort of honesty and purity was this, we may well ask, to
look on at these pretty maids so performing publicly? Honesty was
it never a whit, but pleasure in the sight of them, and especially of
their bodily movements and dancing postures, and above all in
their wrestling; and chiefest of all when they came to fall one atop
of the other, as they say in Latin: ‘She underneath, he atop; he
underneath, she atop.’ You will never persuade me ‘twas all
honesty and purity herein with these Spartan maidens. I ween
there is never chastity so chaste that would not have been shaken
thereby, or that, so making in public and by day these feint assaults,
they did not presently in privity and by night and on assignation
proceed to greater combats and night attacks.”</p></div>

In <cite>The Night of Power</cite> we have the story of a man who,
believing that three prayers would be granted to him, consults his
wife as to what he shall ask. She advises him to ask Allah to
“greaten and magnify his yard.” He does so, whereupon his yard
“became as big as a column, and he could neither sit nor stand
nor move about nor even stir from his stead; and when he would
have carnally known his wife, she fled before him from place to
place.” In distress the husband asks, as his second wish, to be
delivered of this burden, and “immediately his prickle disappeared
altogether and he became clean smooth. When his wife saw this,
she said: ‘I have no occasion for thee now thou art become pegless
as an eunuch, shaven and shorn.... Pray Allah the most
High to restore thee thy yard as it was.’ So he prayed to his Lord
and his prickle was restored to its first estate. Thus the man lost
his three wishes by the ill counsel and lack of wit in the woman.”

“Fleece,” of course, is an accepted erotic term for pubic
hair (Farmer: <cite>Slang and its Analogues</cite>); <i>c.f.</i> also the French term
<i lang="fr">toison</i>. Helène’s hirsute adornment is in keeping with psychological
precept&mdash;that hairiness and sensuality go hand in hand.
Havelock Ellis, in his <cite>Studies</cite>, quotes numerous authorities who
are strongly of this opinion, (vol. 5: <cite>Erotic Symbolism</cite>). Lombroso,
he adds, found that prostitutes generally tend to be hairy. In
another volume of his <cite>Studies</cite>, Havelock Ellis relates the history of
a man for whom a hirsute <i lang="la">mons veneris</i> always had a peculiar attraction.
“When accosted by prostitutes,” says the subject of this
history, “I would never go with them unless assured that the <i lang="la">mons
veneris</i> was very hirsute.” That genial old soldier Brantôme (<cite>Lives
of Fair and Gallant Ladies</cite>: Translated by A. R. Allinson: Paris,
Charles Carrington, 1901) says: “I have heard speak of a certain
great lady, and I have known her myself and do know her still,
who is all shaggy and hairy over the chest, stomach, shoulders and
all down the spine, and on her bottom, like a savage.... The proverb
hath it, no person thus hairy is ever rich or wanton; but
verily in this case the lady is both the one and the other, I can
assure you....” Brantôme also speaks of women who “have hair
in that part not curly at all, but so long and drooping, you would
say they were the moustachios of a Saracen’s head. Nathless
they do never remove this fleece, but prefer to have it so, seeing
there is a saying: ‘A grassgrown path and a hairy coynte are both
good roads to ride.’ ... I have heard speak of another fair and honourable
lady which did have the hair of this part so long she would
entwine the same with strings or ribbons of silk, crimson and other
colours, and have them curled like the curls of a wig, and attached
to her thighs. And in such guise would she show her <i lang="fr">motte</i> to her
husband or lover. Or else she would unwind the ribbons and
cords, so that the hair did remain after in curl, and looking prettier
so than it would otherwise have done.” Elsewhere Brantôme tells
of a gentleman of his acquaintance who, while sleeping with a
very beautiful lady, “and one of good condition, and doing his devoir
with her, did find in that part sundry hairs so sharp and
prickly that ‘twas with all the difficulty in the world he could
finish, so sharply did these prick and pierce him....” Abnormal
growth of pubic hair is by no means confined to <i lang="fr">conte</i> and fable.
Jahn, says Havelock Ellis in his <cite>Studies</cite>, delivered a woman whose
pubic hair was longer than that of her head, reaching below her
knees. Paulini also knew a woman “whose pubic hair nearly
reached her knees and was sold to make wigs. Bartholin
mentions a soldier’s wife who plaited her pubic hair behind her
back.” (<cite>Erotic Symbolism</cite>). We have no actual evidence that
Helène’s growth was of these abnormal dimensions, but it was obviously
out of the ordinary to provoke comment from a man of
Casanova’s experience.</p></div>

Pietro Aretino, author of <cite>The Ragionamenti</cite>, is generally

venereal act might be performed. To the many he is known solely

We make no apology for the frequent extracts from
<cite>Kruptadia</cite> to be found in this volume and those to follow of
<i>Anthologica Rarissima</i>. <cite>Kruptadia</cite>, perhaps the most remarkable
<i lang="fr">recueil</i> of folk lore stories, songs, sayings and proverbs in the
world, is a work far too little known to the student and bibliophile.
Its rarity may be explained by the fact that comparatively few
copies of each volume were struck off. Of Vol. 2, from which
“The Wedding Night of Jean the Fool” is taken, only 135 numbered
copies were done. A complete 12-volume set, in the original
format (the work was begun in Heilbronn by Henninger Frères
and completed in Paris by Welter) is not often seen, and we count
ourselves fortunate in having one before us as we write. Havelock
Ellis frequently refers to the collection in his <cite>Studies in the Psychology
of Sex</cite>, while Pisanus Fraxi, the great bibliographer of erotic,
prohibited and uncommon books, was just able to notice the first
two volumes in his <cite>Catena Librorum Tacendorum</cite>, (London:
Privately Printed: 1885). He pays generous tribute to the production.
“Students of folk lore,” he writes, “will hail with delight
the appearance of this well-printed and carefully got up little
volume, to be followed, let us hope, by many others of the same
kind, equally remarkable for talented and faithful rendering, and
masterly editing.” Dealing with the tales themselves, he goes on
to say that “they reveal to us in an interesting and unequivocal
manner the feelings, aspirations, modes of thought, manner of
living of the people who tell them, and are possibly one of the
most valuable contributions to the study of folk lore which has yet
appeared.... They are all characteristic&mdash;all good.” Fraxi then
gives the pith of “The Enchanted Ring,” which we have already
printed at length in this volume. In the concluding pages of his
<cite>Catena Librorum Tacendorum</cite>, Fraxi states that vol. 2 of <cite>Kruptadia</cite>
has reached him in time to mention briefly its contents. Since
these words were written, ten other volumes have been issued&mdash;a
veritable mine of entertaining and instructive information. We
even go so far as to say that genuine students of folk lore and
collectors of curious literature cannot afford to ignore <cite>Kruptadia</cite>,
even as they should have access to Pisanus Fraxi’s 3-volume
work, <cite>INDEX LIBRORUM PROHIBITORUM</cite>, <cite>CENTURIA
LIBRORUM ABSCONDITORUM</cite>, and <cite>CATENA LIBRORUM
TACENDORUM</cite>. Possession of these works by all is impossible
owing to their rarity, cost and small imprint. Not every student
can afford to pay £20 to £30 for the complete set of <cite>Kruptadia</cite>,
even if he be lucky enough to chance on such a find, while Fraxi’s
amazing bibliography, in the sale room alone, commands about
£35; and while the price tends steadily to increase, the appearance
of the complete 3-volume set as steadily decreases.</p></div>

play on words is remarkably apt in the last few lines of the story,
<em>peloton</em> exactly connoting, in the mind of the simple girl, the
youth’s testicles and pubic hair.</p></div>

“The belief that young pigeons’ blood resembles the
virginal discharge is universal,” says Sir Richard Burton, in a
footnote; “but the blood most resembling man’s is that of the pig,
which in other points is so very human. In our day Arabs and
Hindus rarely submit to inspection the nuptial sheet, as practised
by the Israelites and Persians. The bride takes to bed a white
kerchief with which she staunches the blood and next morning the
stains are displayed in the Harem. In Darfour this is done by the
bridegroom. “<i lang="la">Prima Venus debet esse cruenta</i>” (Love’s first battle
should be bloody), say the Easterns with much truth, and they
have no faith in our complaisant creed which allows the hymen-membrane
to disappear by any but one accident.” The creed, of
course, is not peculiar to the East, and realistic descriptions of this
“sanguinary combat” will be found in Nicolas Chorier’s <cite>Dialogues</cite>,
<cite>Memoirs of a Woman of Pleasure</cite>, (<i lang="la">op. cit.</i>), and other erotic works.

Note by Sir Richard Burton: The Koran says (chap. 2):
“Your wives are your tillage: go in therefore unto your tillage
in what manner soever you will.” Usually this is understood as
meaning in any posture, standing or sitting, lying, backwards or
forwards. Yet there is a popular saying about the man whom the
woman rides (vulg. <em>St. George</em>; in France, <i lang="fr">le postillion</i>): “Cursed
be he who maketh woman Heaven and himself earth!” Some
hold the Koranic passage to have been revealed in confutation of
the Jews, who pretended that if a man lay with his wife backwards,
he would beget a cleverer child. Others again understood it of
preposterous venery; which is absurd: every ancient law-giver
framed his code to increase the true wealth of the people&mdash;population&mdash;and
severely punished all processes, like onanism,
which impeded it. The Persians utilise the hatred of women for
such misuse when they would force a wife to demand a divorce
and thus forfeit her claim to dowry; they convert them into
catamites till, after a month or so, they lose all patience and leave
the house. We do not propose to add to Sir Richard’s note,
reserving our remarks on the subject for their proper place in a
subsequent volume.</p></div>

Note by Sir Richard: Easterns still believe in what
Westerns know to be an impossibility, human beings with the
parts and proportions of both sexes equally developed and capable
of reproduction; and Al-Islam even provides special rules for them.
... The old Greeks dreamed, after their fashion, a beautiful
poetic dream of a human animal uniting the contradictory
beauties of man and woman. The duality of the generative
organs seems an old Egyptian tradition; at least we find it in
<cite>Genesis</cite> (1.27), where the image of the Deity is created male and
female, before man was formed out of the dust of the ground (2.7).
The old tradition found its way to India (if the Hindus did not
borrow the idea from the Greeks); and one of the forms of
Mahadeva, the third person of their triad, is entitled “Ardhanári”
= the Half-Woman, which has suggested to them some charming
pictures. Europeans, seeing the left breast conspicuously feminine,
have indulged in silly surmises about the “Amazons.”</p></div>

<cite>The Perfumed Garden.</cite> As illustrating our subject, the
Cheikh Nefzaoui tells a quaint story of a man who, owing to
physical disability, was unable to satisfy the sexual needs of his
wife. A wise man gives him a remedy whereby his member grows
“long and thick.” The Cheikh continues: “When his wife saw it
in that state she was surprised, but it came still better when he
made her feel in the matter of enjoyment quite another thing than
she had been accustomed to experience; he began in fact to work
her with his tool in quite a remarkable manner, to such a point that
she rattled and sighed and sobbed during the operation. As soon
as the wife found in her husband such eminently good qualities,
she gave him her fortune, and placed her person and all she had
at his disposal.”</p></div>

<cite>Lysistrata</cite> and <cite>The Ecclesiazusæ</cite>. In the former play, Athenian
women promise Lysistrata that, if forced to intercourse by their
husbands, <em>they will not lift their legs in the air</em>; in the latter, we
have a woman saying: “How are we going to lift up our arms in
the Assembly (<i>i.e.</i>, vote), we, who only know how to lift our legs
in the act of love?”

<p>
Two of the authorities quoted by Havelock Ellis on p. 97
of the foregoing <i>Excursus</i> merit further brief mention. Martin
Schurig, author of <cite>Parthenologia</cite> and numerous other medical
works, flourished as a physician in Dresden between 1688 and 1733.
Although many of his theories have long since been exploded, his
great erudition is much to be admired. His books deal with the
most amazing questions; among the many curious passages in
<cite>Parthenologia</cite> will be found the following: “Chastity put to the
proof by a hot iron and boiling water”; “Conception without
insertion of the <i lang="la">penis</i>”; “Andramytes, King of the Lydori, was the
inventor of castration of women, and Semiramis of that of men.”
Dr. Sinibaldus’ <cite>Geneanthropeia</cite>, published in 1642, is a very remarkable
work on physical love and its aberrations, treating, for
example, of “The shape of the Phallus”; “Eunuchism”;
“Aphrodisiacs”; “Influence of the Stars on Copulation”; “Effects
and manner of Copulation”; “Pleasure of Copulation as enjoyed
by man and woman.” Little is known of Sinibaldus’ life beyond
that he was a doctor at Rome. His <cite>Geneanthropeia</cite>, according to
Pisanus Fraxi, (<cite>Index Librorum Prohibitorum</cite>: London, 1877), has
been rendered, in a very emasculated form, into English, under
the title of <cite>Rare Verities. The Cabinet of Venus Unlocked</cite>: London,
1658. The volume is rare, but a copy is to be found in the British
Museum.</p></div>

<cite>Stories of Picardy</cite>, we have the tale of a young girl who had been
seduced, but had married a half-witted youth, whom she was
forced to instruct in the art of love. When they were in bed
together, “she showed him how children are made&mdash;a business
entirely unknown to him. After the explanations had been given
in theory, the husband mounted upon his wife, desiring to show
that he had learned his lesson well; but the young wife cried out
in surprise: ‘’Tis too high! ‘Tis too high!’ An instant later she
was forced to say: ‘’Tis too low! ‘Tis too low!’ Several other of
his efforts having failed, she told her husband that he did but
knock at the side of the door. Whereat the latter, aweary of ‘Too
high’ and ‘Too low,’ exclaimed: ‘Since thou knowest the spot so
well, put it there thyself!’”</p></div>

It is followed by the word <i lang="fr">joustouer</i>, “to tilt or joust,” or “a tilter, a

seems to keep more faithfully to the spirit of the story. On the

(<cite>Slang and its Analogues</cite>: vol. 5, p. 290), quotes Rabelais as employing
the word in this sense. Landes, (<cite>Glossaire érotique de la langue

a curious and valuable little work dealing with the lesser known
expressions and metaphors of venery, and intended to serve as a
complement to the ordinary erotic dictionary, describes <i lang="fr">bourdon</i>
as “the virile member, the grand chord which gives the note in the
amorous duet.” The <cite>Memoirs of Miss Fanny</cite> are quoted: “ ...
enraptured, split open by the enormous size of my ravisher’s
<i lang="fr">bourdon</i>, my thighs all bloodstained, I remained for some time

This story, the 86th of <cite>Les Cent Nouvelles Nouvelles</cite>, is
singularly lacking in climax when compared with the majority of
old <i lang="fr">fabliaux</i>. The opening is very promising; but once the
husband has stated his case, the fabric seems to fall to pieces, and
the wife’s final speech is as silly as it is unjustified. The author
has tried to round off the story by dragging in the ages-old tag
about the woman who, from hating the pleasures of love, becomes
a veritable glutton for them. Compared with “Beyond the Mark,”
which is artistic and dramatic from the first to the last line, “Foolish
Fear” is a poor thing. Nevertheless, we have thought fit to include
it in this anthology because its opening is as characteristic as its
finish is <i lang="fr">un</i>characteristic of this type of <i lang="fr">fabliaux</i>.</p></div>

were unaware of the medical significance of the test, for they

equally absurd test of virginity. They measured the circumference
of the neck with a thread. Then the girl under trial took the two
ends of the magic thread in her teeth, and if it was found to be so
long that its bight could be passed over her head, it was clear she
was not a maid. By this rule all the thin girls might pass for
vestals, and all the plump ones for the reverse.”</p></div>

Blondeau, in his <cite>Dictionnaire Érotique</cite> (Isidore Liseux: Paris, 1885),
gives no word in his collection of Latin terms for <i lang="la">penis</i> which
approximates exactly to the sense of awl. Landes, Delvau (<cite>Dictionnaire
Érotique</cite>), and <cite>Le petit Citateur</cite> (<i lang="la">op. cit. supra</i>) make no
mention of the word. In our story Danilka, in his very primitive
fashion, has used an expression which explains in the simplest
way his actions in the sleigh.</p></div>

<em>Touzle</em> or <em>Tousle</em>, in its original sense, meant “to rumple”&mdash;“to
pull or mess about,” but came in time to signify, in erotic
slang, the act of “mastering a woman by romping.” (<i lang="la">Vide</i> Farmer:
<cite>Slang and its Analogues</cite>.) It belongs to that class of word connoting
the sexual act which may be described as <em>energetic</em>, as implying a
sense of lively action and movement. Farmer, under his key-word
<em>Ride</em>, gives a number of similar terms, among them:&mdash;to <em>belly-bump</em>;
to <em>bounce</em>; to <em>cuddle</em>; to <em>ferret</em>; to <em>frisk</em>; to <em>fumble</em>; to
<em>hug</em>; to <em>hustle</em>; to <em>jiggle</em>; to <em>jumble</em>; to <em>muddle</em>; to <em>niggle</em>; to

“The text has a play upon words,” says the translator,
“which could be translated if the French words had the same
meaning as the Latin:&mdash;<i lang="la">Dixit (puella) se non amplius dolere caput.
Tum ille: ‘At ego nunc doleo caudam.’</i> (The girl said that she no
longer had a pain in the head. Said the husband: ‘But I have a
pain in my tail.’)” This note, we must confess, is a source of some
mystification to us, since the relationship between the French and
Latin words is both simple and direct. <i lang="la">Cauda</i>, of course, is the
Latin word for <em>tail</em>: in the erotic sense it designates the <i lang="la">penis</i>.
(<i>C.f.</i> Blondeau: <cite>Dictionnaire érotique latin-française</cite>: Liseux: Paris,
1885.) The Italians use the word <i lang="it">coda</i> in a similar sense. <em>Tail</em>, in
French, is <i lang="fr">queue</i>; in erotic literature it is also a highly common
term for the <i lang="la">membrum virile</i>. (<i>C.f.</i> Landes: <cite>Glossaire érotique de
la langue française</cite>, and Farmer: <cite>Slang and its Analogues</cite>.) Again,
in English, <i>tail</i> is a slang synonym either for the <i lang="la">penis</i> or the
female <i lang="la">pudendum</i>. <i>C.f.</i> Farmer: <cite>Slang and its Analogues</cite>, who gives
numerous examples of the use of the word in this sense. We
append a few of his quotations:&mdash;(1) Chaucer, <cite>Cant. Tales</cite>, 6047-8:
“For al so siker as cold engendreth hayl, A likerous mouth must
han a likerous TAYL.” (2) Rochester, <cite>Poems</cite>: “Then pulling out
the rector of the females, Nine times he bath’d him in their piping
tails.” (3) Motteux, <cite>Rabelais</cite>, V., xxi.: “They were pulling and
hauling the man like mad, telling him that it is the most grievous ...
thing in nature for the TAIL to be on fire....”</p></div>

States without permission and without paying copyright
royalties. Special rules, set forth in the General Terms of Use part
of this license, apply to copying and distributing Project
Gutenberg-tm electronic works to protect the PROJECT GUTENBERG-tm

performances and research. They may be modified and printed and given
away--you may do practically ANYTHING in the United States with eBooks
not protected by U.S. copyright law. Redistribution is subject to the

START: FULL LICENSE

THE FULL PROJECT GUTENBERG LICENSE
PLEASE READ THIS BEFORE YOU DISTRIBUTE OR USE THIS WORK

To protect the Project Gutenberg-tm mission of promoting the free
distribution of electronic works, by using or distributing this work
(or any other work associated in any way with the phrase "Project
Gutenberg"), you agree to comply with all the terms of the Full
Project Gutenberg-tm License available with this file or online at
www.gutenberg.org/license.

Section 1. General Terms of Use and Redistributing Project
Gutenberg-tm electronic works

1.A. By reading or using any part of this Project Gutenberg-tm
electronic work, you indicate that you have read, understand, agree to
and accept all the terms of this license and intellectual property
(trademark/copyright) agreement. If you do not agree to abide by all
the terms of this agreement, you must cease using and return or
destroy all copies of Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works in your
possession. If you paid a fee for obtaining a copy of or access to a
Project Gutenberg-tm electronic work and you do not agree to be bound
by the terms of this agreement, you may obtain a refund from the
person or entity to whom you paid the fee as set forth in paragraph
1.E.8.

1.B. "Project Gutenberg" is a registered trademark. It may only be
used on or associated in any way with an electronic work by people who
agree to be bound by the terms of this agreement. There are a few
things that you can do with most Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works
even without complying with the full terms of this agreement. See
paragraph 1.C below. There are a lot of things you can do with Project
Gutenberg-tm electronic works if you follow the terms of this
agreement and help preserve free future access to Project Gutenberg-tm
electronic works. See paragraph 1.E below.

1.C. The Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation ("the
Foundation" or PGLAF), owns a compilation copyright in the collection
of Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works. Nearly all the individual
works in the collection are in the public domain in the United
States. If an individual work is unprotected by copyright law in the
United States and you are located in the United States, we do not
claim a right to prevent you from copying, distributing, performing,
displaying or creating derivative works based on the work as long as
all references to Project Gutenberg are removed. Of course, we hope
that you will support the Project Gutenberg-tm mission of promoting
free access to electronic works by freely sharing Project Gutenberg-tm
works in compliance with the terms of this agreement for keeping the
Project Gutenberg-tm name associated with the work. You can easily
comply with the terms of this agreement by keeping this work in the
same format with its attached full Project Gutenberg-tm License when
you share it without charge with others.

1.D. The copyright laws of the place where you are located also govern
what you can do with this work. Copyright laws in most countries are
in a constant state of change. If you are outside the United States,
check the laws of your country in addition to the terms of this
agreement before downloading, copying, displaying, performing,
distributing or creating derivative works based on this work or any
other Project Gutenberg-tm work. The Foundation makes no
representations concerning the copyright status of any work in any
country outside the United States.

1.E. Unless you have removed all references to Project Gutenberg:

1.E.1. The following sentence, with active links to, or other
immediate access to, the full Project Gutenberg-tm License must appear
prominently whenever any copy of a Project Gutenberg-tm work (any work
on which the phrase "Project Gutenberg" appears, or with which the
phrase "Project Gutenberg" is associated) is accessed, displayed,
performed, viewed, copied or distributed:

  This eBook is for the use of anyone anywhere in the United States and
  most other parts of the world at no cost and with almost no
  restrictions whatsoever. You may copy it, give it away or re-use it
  under the terms of the Project Gutenberg License included with this
  eBook or online at www.gutenberg.org. If you are not located in the
  United States, you'll have to check the laws of the country where you
  are located before using this ebook.

1.E.2. If an individual Project Gutenberg-tm electronic work is
derived from texts not protected by U.S. copyright law (does not
contain a notice indicating that it is posted with permission of the
copyright holder), the work can be copied and distributed to anyone in
the United States without paying any fees or charges. If you are
redistributing or providing access to a work with the phrase "Project
Gutenberg" associated with or appearing on the work, you must comply
either with the requirements of paragraphs 1.E.1 through 1.E.7 or
obtain permission for the use of the work and the Project Gutenberg-tm
trademark as set forth in paragraphs 1.E.8 or 1.E.9.

1.E.3. If an individual Project Gutenberg-tm electronic work is posted
with the permission of the copyright holder, your use and distribution
must comply with both paragraphs 1.E.1 through 1.E.7 and any
additional terms imposed by the copyright holder. Additional terms
will be linked to the Project Gutenberg-tm License for all works
posted with the permission of the copyright holder found at the
beginning of this work.

1.E.4. Do not unlink or detach or remove the full Project Gutenberg-tm
License terms from this work, or any files containing a part of this
work or any other work associated with Project Gutenberg-tm.

1.E.5. Do not copy, display, perform, distribute or redistribute this
electronic work, or any part of this electronic work, without
prominently displaying the sentence set forth in paragraph 1.E.1 with
active links or immediate access to the full terms of the Project
Gutenberg-tm License.

1.E.6. You may convert to and distribute this work in any binary,
compressed, marked up, nonproprietary or proprietary form, including
any word processing or hypertext form. However, if you provide access
to or distribute copies of a Project Gutenberg-tm work in a format
other than "Plain Vanilla ASCII" or other format used in the official
version posted on the official Project Gutenberg-tm web site
(www.gutenberg.org), you must, at no additional cost, fee or expense
to the user, provide a copy, a means of exporting a copy, or a means
of obtaining a copy upon request, of the work in its original "Plain
Vanilla ASCII" or other form. Any alternate format must include the
full Project Gutenberg-tm License as specified in paragraph 1.E.1.

1.E.7. Do not charge a fee for access to, viewing, displaying,
performing, copying or distributing any Project Gutenberg-tm works
unless you comply with paragraph 1.E.8 or 1.E.9.

1.E.8. You may charge a reasonable fee for copies of or providing
access to or distributing Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works
provided that

* You pay a royalty fee of 20% of the gross profits you derive from
  the use of Project Gutenberg-tm works calculated using the method
  you already use to calculate your applicable taxes. The fee is owed
  to the owner of the Project Gutenberg-tm trademark, but he has
  agreed to donate royalties under this paragraph to the Project
  Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation. Royalty payments must be paid
  within 60 days following each date on which you prepare (or are
  legally required to prepare) your periodic tax returns. Royalty
  payments should be clearly marked as such and sent to the Project
  Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation at the address specified in
  Section 4, "Information about donations to the Project Gutenberg
  Literary Archive Foundation."

* You provide a full refund of any money paid by a user who notifies
  you in writing (or by e-mail) within 30 days of receipt that s/he
  does not agree to the terms of the full Project Gutenberg-tm
  License. You must require such a user to return or destroy all
  copies of the works possessed in a physical medium and discontinue
  all use of and all access to other copies of Project Gutenberg-tm
  works.

* You provide, in accordance with paragraph 1.F.3, a full refund of
  any money paid for a work or a replacement copy, if a defect in the
  electronic work is discovered and reported to you within 90 days of
  receipt of the work.

* You comply with all other terms of this agreement for free
  distribution of Project Gutenberg-tm works.

1.E.9. If you wish to charge a fee or distribute a Project
Gutenberg-tm electronic work or group of works on different terms than
are set forth in this agreement, you must obtain permission in writing
from both the Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation and The
Project Gutenberg Trademark LLC, the owner of the Project Gutenberg-tm
trademark. Contact the Foundation as set forth in Section 3 below.

1.F.

1.F.1. Project Gutenberg volunteers and employees expend considerable
effort to identify, do copyright research on, transcribe and proofread
works not protected by U.S. copyright law in creating the Project
Gutenberg-tm collection. Despite these efforts, Project Gutenberg-tm
electronic works, and the medium on which they may be stored, may
contain "Defects," such as, but not limited to, incomplete, inaccurate
or corrupt data, transcription errors, a copyright or other
intellectual property infringement, a defective or damaged disk or
other medium, a computer virus, or computer codes that damage or
cannot be read by your equipment.

1.F.2. LIMITED WARRANTY, DISCLAIMER OF DAMAGES - Except for the "Right
of Replacement or Refund" described in paragraph 1.F.3, the Project
Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation, the owner of the Project
Gutenberg-tm trademark, and any other party distributing a Project
Gutenberg-tm electronic work under this agreement, disclaim all
liability to you for damages, costs and expenses, including legal
fees. YOU AGREE THAT YOU HAVE NO REMEDIES FOR NEGLIGENCE, STRICT
LIABILITY, BREACH OF WARRANTY OR BREACH OF CONTRACT EXCEPT THOSE
PROVIDED IN PARAGRAPH 1.F.3. YOU AGREE THAT THE FOUNDATION, THE
TRADEMARK OWNER, AND ANY DISTRIBUTOR UNDER THIS AGREEMENT WILL NOT BE
LIABLE TO YOU FOR ACTUAL, DIRECT, INDIRECT, CONSEQUENTIAL, PUNITIVE OR
INCIDENTAL DAMAGES EVEN IF YOU GIVE NOTICE OF THE POSSIBILITY OF SUCH
DAMAGE.

1.F.3. LIMITED RIGHT OF REPLACEMENT OR REFUND - If you discover a
defect in this electronic work within 90 days of receiving it, you can
receive a refund of the money (if any) you paid for it by sending a
written explanation to the person you received the work from. If you
received the work on a physical medium, you must return the medium
with your written explanation. The person or entity that provided you
with the defective work may elect to provide a replacement copy in
lieu of a refund. If you received the work electronically, the person
or entity providing it to you may choose to give you a second
opportunity to receive the work electronically in lieu of a refund. If
the second copy is also defective, you may demand a refund in writing
without further opportunities to fix the problem.

1.F.4. Except for the limited right of replacement or refund set forth
in paragraph 1.F.3, this work is provided to you 'AS-IS', WITH NO
OTHER WARRANTIES OF ANY KIND, EXPRESS OR IMPLIED, INCLUDING BUT NOT
LIMITED TO WARRANTIES OF MERCHANTABILITY OR FITNESS FOR ANY PURPOSE.

1.F.5. Some states do not allow disclaimers of certain implied
warranties or the exclusion or limitation of certain types of
damages. If any disclaimer or limitation set forth in this agreement
violates the law of the state applicable to this agreement, the
agreement shall be interpreted to make the maximum disclaimer or
limitation permitted by the applicable state law. The invalidity or
unenforceability of any provision of this agreement shall not void the
remaining provisions.

1.F.6. INDEMNITY - You agree to indemnify and hold the Foundation, the
trademark owner, any agent or employee of the Foundation, anyone
providing copies of Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works in
accordance with this agreement, and any volunteers associated with the
production, promotion and distribution of Project Gutenberg-tm
electronic works, harmless from all liability, costs and expenses,
including legal fees, that arise directly or indirectly from any of
the following which you do or cause to occur: (a) distribution of this
or any Project Gutenberg-tm work, (b) alteration, modification, or
additions or deletions to any Project Gutenberg-tm work, and (c) any
Defect you cause.

Section 2. Information about the Mission of Project Gutenberg-tm

Project Gutenberg-tm is synonymous with the free distribution of
electronic works in formats readable by the widest variety of
computers including obsolete, old, middle-aged and new computers. It
exists because of the efforts of hundreds of volunteers and donations
from people in all walks of life.

Volunteers and financial support to provide volunteers with the
assistance they need are critical to reaching Project Gutenberg-tm's
goals and ensuring that the Project Gutenberg-tm collection will
remain freely available for generations to come. In 2001, the Project
Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation was created to provide a secure
and permanent future for Project Gutenberg-tm and future
generations. To learn more about the Project Gutenberg Literary
Archive Foundation and how your efforts and donations can help, see
Sections 3 and 4 and the Foundation information page at
www.gutenberg.org Section 3. Information about the Project Gutenberg
Literary Archive Foundation

Section 4. Information about Donations to the Project Gutenberg
Literary Archive Foundation

Project Gutenberg-tm depends upon and cannot survive without wide
spread public support and donations to carry out its mission of
increasing the number of public domain and licensed works that can be
freely distributed in machine readable form accessible by the widest
array of equipment including outdated equipment. Many small donations
($1 to $5,000) are particularly important to maintaining tax exempt
status with the IRS.

The Foundation is committed to complying with the laws regulating
charities and charitable donations in all 50 states of the United
States. Compliance requirements are not uniform and it takes a
considerable effort, much paperwork and many fees to meet and keep up
with these requirements. We do not solicit donations in locations
where we have not received written confirmation of compliance. To SEND
DONATIONS or determine the status of compliance for any particular
state visit www.gutenberg.org/donate

While we cannot and do not solicit contributions from states where we
have not met the solicitation requirements, we know of no prohibition
against accepting unsolicited donations from donors in such states who
approach us with offers to donate.

International donations are gratefully accepted, but we cannot make
any statements concerning tax treatment of donations received from
outside the United States. U.S. laws alone swamp our small staff.

Please check the Project Gutenberg Web pages for current donation
methods and addresses. Donations are accepted in a number of other
ways including checks, online payments and credit card donations. To
donate, please visit: www.gutenberg.org/donate

Section 5. General Information About Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works.

Professor Michael S. Hart was the originator of the Project
Gutenberg-tm concept of a library of electronic works that could be
freely shared with anyone. For forty years, he produced and
distributed Project Gutenberg-tm eBooks with only a loose network of
volunteer support.

Project Gutenberg-tm eBooks are often created from several printed
editions, all of which are confirmed as not protected by copyright in
the U.S. unless a copyright notice is included. Thus, we do not
necessarily keep eBooks in compliance with any particular paper
edition.

Most people start at our Web site which has the main PG search
facility: www.gutenberg.org

This Web site includes information about Project Gutenberg-tm,
including how to make donations to the Project Gutenberg Literary
Archive Foundation, how to help produce our new eBooks, and how to
subscribe to our email newsletter to hear about new eBooks.
